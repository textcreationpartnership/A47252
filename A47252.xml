            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>AMong all the Noble Preſages of Wit, and Honour, there is not one by which YOUR HIGH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS hath given greater Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Hopes of theſe Kingdoms, than by a ſurprizing Curioſity, and an impatient Deſire of Knowledge. For the ſatisfying of ſo Generous Inclinations, YOUR HIGHNESS cannot but
<pb facs="tcp:66439:3"/>ſeek an early Acquaintance with the <hi>Roman</hi> State. It muſt needs pleaſe YOU, SIR, to underſtand the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of that People, before YOU ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear the Rival of their Glory: And the firſt Steps to both theſe Attainments will be alike uneaſie. Many Fatigues are to be undergone ere YOU ſurpaſs them in Action and Conduct: And in the ſame Manner, before YOU are intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd into the more delightful Scenes of their Policy and Government, YOUR HIGHNESS ſhould be <hi>firſt</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented with the rougher Proſpect of their Cuſtoms and Ceremonies.</p>
            <p>For Your Direction in ſo Noble (tho' ſo Intricate) a Path of Ancient Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, YOUR HIGHNESS is deſir'd to accept this ſmall Endeavour; no otherwiſe than YOU would a few Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows or a little Model, to give YOU, SIR, the firſt Notion of ſome admir'd Picture, or ſome magnificent Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:66439:3"/>
            <p>There is one Cuſtom which I am apt to fanſie YOUR HIGHNESS will read with particular Pleaſure; I mean, SIR, the <hi>TROJAN GAME;</hi> a Martial Exerciſe, perform'd by the Youth of the firſt Quatity in <hi>Rome,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch a Captain as Your ſelf: And deriving its Original from young <hi>Aſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> whom I need not fear to mention as your Precedent, ſince YOU have already honour'd Him with your Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>It may be expected perhaps that out of the many Illuſtrious <hi>Romans,</hi> I ſhould here propoſe to YOUR HIGHNESS ſome of the moſt Celebrated Examples of <hi>Virtue</hi> and great <hi>Atchievements.</hi> But this would prove a needleſs Piece of Service; ſince YOU cannot miſs Your Way in the purſuit of the <hi>Firſt,</hi> while YOUR HIGHNESS go's on like the <hi>Trojan</hi> Prince,
<q>Matre Deâ monſtrante viam.</q>
            </p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE uſefulneſs of this Deſign not being like to be call'd in queſtion, I am oblig'd no farther than to give a ſhort Hiſtory of what attempts have hitherto been made of the ſame Nature, with ſome Account of the preſent <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking.</p>
            <p>Not to make a Catalogue of the many Tracts on particular Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>Roman</hi> Antiquities, the Two Authors moſt in requeſt for this Piece of Knowledge, are <hi>Roſinus</hi> and <hi>Godwin;</hi> the firſt as a full Syſtem, the other as an Abridgement or Compendium. We have nothing more compleat than <hi>Roſinus</hi> taken altogether: But he will appear very deficient in many Points, if compar'd with other Learned Men who have labour'd in the adorning ſome one Part of his General Subject. Thus, I believe, his Book of War has Scarce been look'd into ſince the Publiſhing of <hi>Lipſius</hi> his admirable Comment on <hi>Polybius.</hi> His Accounts of the Habits, Senate, Laws and Funerals, will never be ſet in Competition with the more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate Pieces of <hi>Ferrarius</hi> and <hi>Rubenius,</hi> of <hi>Paulus Manutius</hi> and <hi>Kirchman.</hi> Not to urge that the <hi>Names,</hi> the <hi>Money,</hi> the <hi>Private Games,</hi> with ſeveral leſſer Topicks are entirely omitted; and many more ſubſtantial Cuſtoms but lightly touch'd. The <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipomena</hi> of <hi>Dempſter,</hi> which are added in the beſt Editions, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Name of Notes on this Author, ſeem for the moſt part purely a Tranſcript of Common Places, gather'd from the Claſſicks and other Writers, with little Connexion. And therefore tho' they ſerve now and then for a Supplement to <hi>Roſinus,</hi> yet 'tis impoſſible they ſhould be very inſtructive.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Godwin</hi>'s <hi>Anthilogia</hi> (which we uſually meet with in our Schools) beſides that it wants all the Advantages which we have receiv'd from the Learned within theſe Threeſcore Years, is ſo Short and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſatisfactory in Subjects of the greateſt Conſequence; ſo lin'd with Phraſes, which are to be found in all our Dictionaries; ſo ſtuff'd with long Paſſages of <hi>Latin,</hi> untranſlated; has ſo little Method, and runs ſo dry and heavy in the reading, that I fanſie 'tis a
<pb facs="tcp:66439:5"/>general Wiſh it were exchang'd for ſomething elſe in the ſame Kind, of greater uſe, and more agreeable Entertainment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For Cantelius de Romanâ Republicâ,</hi> To me the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> ſeems very unhappy, that by ſpending half his Book in giving us a long Relation of the <hi>Roman</hi> Wars, Battels, Deaths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which moſt Perſons would rather learn from the Original Hiſtorians; he has ſo ſtraitn'd himſelf in the remaining Part, as to paſs for no extraordinary Epitomizer. Beſides that he can't ſpare Room to ſet down one Word of Authority for what he ſays.</p>
            <p>As for theſe Papers: The Two Eſſays of the <hi>Roman</hi> Learning and Education, are, I think, what has not been before attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted in any Language; and on that Account will be the more eaſily Pardon'd if not the better Accepted in the World. The Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Hiſtory of the Riſe, Progreſs, and Decay of the State, has this to ſay for it ſelf, That it carries its own Credentials along with it in conſtant References to the Ancient Writers. I will not here compoſe a Table of Contents for the <hi>Second Part,</hi> which has run out into ſuch length as to make the Body of the Work; only I may hint in a Word or Two, that the many Omiſſions of <hi>Roſinus</hi> and <hi>Godwin</hi> are largely ſupplied, and ſcarce any thing material (that I know of) paſs'd by. That the City with the Famous Structures of all Sorts are deſcrib'd from the Relations of Eye-Witneſſes, and Authors of Credit. That the Laws which occur in the beſt Claſſicks, and often prove a great Hindrance to the Reader, are diſpos'd of under proper Heads in a very convenient Manner; and the trueſt Accounts of their Import, and the Time when they were made, collected from the moſt approv'd Commentators, and from the admir'd Treatiſe of <hi>Manutius.</hi> That in ſome Subjects it was thought proper to follow (for the moſt Part) one particular Author, who had manag'd his Province with univerſal Approbation: As <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonius,</hi> in the <hi>Comitia</hi> and the <hi>Judgments: Lipſius</hi> in the <hi>Art of War,</hi> in the <hi>Gladiators,</hi> and in the <hi>Names. Kirchman</hi> in the <hi>Funerals,</hi> and <hi>Brerewood</hi> in the <hi>Account of the Money.</hi> That the curious Remarques of <hi>Scaliger, Caſaubon, Graevius,</hi> Monſieur and Madam <hi>Dacier</hi> are inſerted on many Occaſions. In ſhort, that no Pains or Charges have been ſpar'd, which might render the Attempt truly ſerviceable, to the good End, for which 'twas deſign'd, the Pleaſure and Benefit of the Reader.</p>

            <p>WHoever conſiders the ſtrange Beginning of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> State, the Frame and Conſtitution on which it was Firſt ſettled, together with the Quality of the Original Members, will think it no Wonder that the People in that early Age ſhou'd have a kind of Fierceneſs, or rather Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in their Temper, utterly averſe to every thing that was Polite and Agreeable. This ſavage Diſpoſition by degrees turn'd into a rigid Severity, which encourag'd them to relie ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the Force of their Native Virtue and Honour, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being beholden to the Advantages of Art for the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Reaſon, or for the aſſiſtance of their Courage. Hence a groſſneſs of Invention paſs'd currant with them for Wit, and Study was look'd on as an unmanly Labour: eſpecially while they found that their exact Diſcipline and unconquer'd Reſolution, render'd them Maſters of Nations much more Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than themſelves.

<pb facs="tcp:66439:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>of State. And what is moſt ſurprizing, Arts and Civility were rather encourag'd than frighted away by the Wars, and the Muſes, like their Patroneſs <hi>Minerva,</hi> had very often their reſidence in the Camp. <hi>Sylla</hi> himſelf wrote Two and Twenty Books of Memoirs<note n="(r)" place="bottom">Plutarch <hi>in</hi> Sylla.</note>, and contributed in an extraordinary Manner, to the Advancement of Knowledge, by tranſporting to <hi>Rome</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Library of <hi>Apellicon,</hi> the <hi>Peripatetick</hi> in which were moſt of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> his Works, which had been long unknown to the greateſt part of their Followers<note n="(s)" place="bottom">Ibid. &amp; <hi>Strabo</hi> lib. 13.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Rival <hi>Marius</hi> was the only Man of Note, in that Age, who retain'd the old Sowreneſs and unpoliſh'd Manner of the firſt <hi>Romans.</hi> He indeed wou'd never ſtudy <hi>Greek,</hi> nor ſuffer that Language to be us'd in any Matters of Conſequence; as thinking it Ridiculous to beſtow Time in that Learning, the Teachers whereof were little better than Slaves<note n="(t)" place="bottom">Plutarch <hi>in</hi> Marius.</note>.</p>
            <p>But then <hi>Lucullus</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>Sylla</hi> in the Military Glory, as to matters of Learning was much his Superiour. In his Youth he had ſo abſolute a Command of the Two only Tongues then in Requeſt, that upon a Project of compiling an Hiſtory, he fairly took his Chance, whether he ſhou'd write in <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,</hi> in Proſe or Verſe. And after all his Feats of Arms in the <hi>Mithridatick</hi> War, when he was depriv'd of his Command by the prevailing Faction of <hi>Pompey,</hi> the great Employment of his Privacy and Retreat, was the promoting of Knowledge. With this Deſign he built a Library, furniſh'd it with a vaſt Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Books, fairly tranſcrib'd, and made it free to all Comers. The Walks and Schools, which he rais'd near the Library, were always full of <hi>Graecians,</hi> who retiring hither from Buſineſs, divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one another with Conferences and Debates, in the ſame Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as was us'd in their own Country; making Advantage of Friendly Converſation toward the improvement of their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings. <hi>Lucullus</hi> himſelf often ſtudied there, ſometimes diſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Learned Men, and ſometimes giving his Advice in Matters of State, to thoſe that deſired it; tho' he meddled with no Publick Buſineſs in Perſon.

            <p>Perhaps the ſame Remark will hold good in his Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy: Or at leaſt with reſpect to his Predeceſſors, the latter Study will yield him an equal Praiſe with the former. For to handle the Subject of Naturals and Morals in the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue, was purely a new Province reſerv'd for his management, and left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touch'd 'till that Time by the Learned. This he lets us know in ſeveral Parts of his Works, particularly in his Proem to the <hi>Tuſculan</hi> Queſtions; where at the ſame time he gives us a ſhort Account of the Progreſs and Advances of Arts among the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> infinitely worth the tranſcribing. <hi>Meum ſemper judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium fuit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>It was always my Opinion</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that either our Country-Men have been more happy in their Inventions of every Kind than the</hi> Greeks, <hi>or that they have made a vaſt Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in whatever they borrow'd from that Nation; and thought worth their while to poliſh and refine. For as to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Life, and the Rules of Breeding and Behaviour, together with the management of Family Concerns, we are Maſters of more exactneſs, and have a much gentiler Air. If we aſcend to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning and regulating of Publick States, our Anceſtors may juſtly claim the Preference in this part of Wiſdom, on account of their admirable Laws and Inſtitutions. In Military Affairs we have made a more conſiderable Advance than any before us; which is ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no leſs to our Diſcipline than to our Native Bravery. ....... 'Tis true</hi> Greece <hi>has always had the Renown beyond us, for their attainments in every Part of Learning; and it was an eaſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Conquer, when they met with no Oppoſition. Poetry (the moſt ancient ſort of Writing) had but a late reception among us: For</hi> Livius Andronicus <hi>preſented his firſt Dramatick Piece</hi> 510 (it ſhou'd be 514) <hi>Years after the Building of</hi> Rome, in the Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of <hi>C. Claudius,</hi> (<hi>Son to</hi> Appius Caecus) <hi>and</hi> M. Tuditanus, <hi>a Year before the Birth of</hi> Ennius, <hi>who is ſenior to</hi> Plautus <hi>and</hi> Naevius.</p>
            <p>As he goes on, he attributes the ſlow Progreſs of Poeſy, to the want of due Reward and Encouragement, and tells us that in a publick Oration of <hi>Cato</hi>'s, it was Objected as a Reproach to <hi>Marcus Nobilior,</hi> that he had carried the Poet <hi>Ennius</hi> with him
<pb facs="tcp:66439:9"/>into <hi>Aetolia,</hi> when he went to reſide there as Governour. That there was no Part of the Mathematicks (which the <hi>Graecians</hi> eſteem'd ſo honourable a Study) of uſe in <hi>Rome,</hi> but the bare Practice of meaſuring and caſting Accompt. For Oratory, he obſerves that the <hi>Romans</hi> embrac'd this very ſoon: but at firſt without the Advantages of a learned Inſtitution; which were afterwards added with ſo good Succeſs, as to ſet them on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Terms, with the moſt Eloquent Maſters of <hi>Greece.</hi> But that Philoſophy had lain neglected 'till that time, and had met with no eminent Authour to adorn it in the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue. This therefore he profeſſeth to undertake as his proper Office, and how happily he ſucceeded in the Attempt, his Works on that Subject will be a laſting Argument.</p>
            <p>If we compare <hi>Tully</hi> with his Friend <hi>Atticus,</hi> we find them both together anſwering the Two excellent Ends of Philoſophy, the Service of the Publick, and the private Eaſe and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of an inoffenſive Life. The former directed all his Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to Action, in the defence of the Common-Wealth, and the oppoſing all Deſigns on its Liberty. The latter by never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring the Scene of Buſineſs, made himſelf equally honour'd and courted by all Parties from <hi>Sylla</hi> to <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar.</hi> The one gain'd to himſelf more Glory, the other more hearty Love and Eſteem; and I believe moſt Perſons wou'd be inclin'd to follow <hi>Atticus,</hi> and to commend <hi>Cicero.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Craſſus, Pompey, Antony, Caeſar, Cato,</hi> and <hi>Brutus,</hi> who made ſuch a Noiſe in the World almoſt all at the ſame time, were the moſt refin'd Scholars of their Age. The Three firſt indeed confin'd themſelves to the Practice of Eloquence, 'till they were wholly diverted by the Profeſſion of Arms. But the Three laſt, as they out-ſhone the former in Oratory, ſo they had made much greater Advances in the other Parts of Humane Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Poetry and Philoſophy were the diverſion of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure Hours, and his Hiſtory will be the Model of good Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, as long as himſelf the Example of great Atchievements.</p>
            <p>The Whole Conduct of <hi>Cato</hi>'s Life, ſhews him a greater <hi>Stoick</hi> than the moſt rigid Profeſſors of that Sect; or howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they might equal him in Knowledge, 'tis certain he ſham'd them in Practice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brutus</hi> had been a Hearer of all the Sects of Philoſophers, and made ſome Proficiency in every one. When a Soldier under <hi>Pompey,</hi> in the Civil Wars, all the time that he was in the Camp, except what he ſpent in the General's Company, he Employ'd in reading and ſtudy. And the very day before
<pb facs="tcp:66439:10"/>the deciſive Battle at <hi>Pharſalia,</hi> tho' it was then the middle of Summer, and the Camp under many inconveniences, and he himſelf extreamly harraſs'd and out of Order; yet while o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were either laid down to ſleep, or taken up with Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions about the iſſue of the Fight, he ſpent all his Time 'till the Evening, in writing an Epitome of <hi>Polybius</hi>

            <p>It's univerſally known, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Literature as well as Empire, was in its higheſt Aſcendant under <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> All the delicate Fruits Tranſplanted from <hi>Greece,</hi> were now in their Bloſſom, being cheriſh'd by the Calmneſs of the Seaſon, and cultivated by the Hand of an Emp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I have often wonder'd that <hi>Maecenas</hi> ſhoul'd all along carry away the ſole Honour of encouraging the Wit and Knowledge of this Reign; when it ſeems Probable that he acted only in imitation of his Maſter; as the Humours of Princes common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly determine the Inclinations of their Favourites. The quite contrary happen'd to the other great Miniſter <hi>Agrippa;</hi> the Glory of his Exploits was referr'd to the Emperour, while the Emperour's Bounty advanc'd <hi>Maecenas</hi> his Eſteem. And indeed the Celebration of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his Triumphs, and the Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyricks on his Piety, were ſufficient to ſet him out in the moſt taking Colours: But had <hi>Maecenas</hi> been denied the ſhining Character of a Patron, he might have roll'd on in Silence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <hi>Epicurus</hi> his Herd, and ſcarce have been ever drawn by the Poet's Hand, unleſs in the ſame Poſture as <hi>Silenus.</hi>

            <p>But whoever of the Two was the Nobler Patron, <hi>Auguſtus</hi> muſt be acknowledg'd to have been the greater Scholar: And for proof we need go no farther than <hi>Suetonius,</hi> who has ſpent no leſs than Six Chapters on the Learning of this Emperour: His prodigious Induſtry in the Study of Eloquence, and Liberal Arts; his Labour in compoſing every thing that he ſpoke in Publick, tho' he had a very good Faculty at <hi>extempore</hi> Harangues; his polite and clean Style; his accurate Knowledge of the <hi>Graecian</hi> Literature, by the aſſiſtance of their beſt Maſters of Rhetoric and Philoſophy; the Thirteenth Book of the Hiſtory of his
<pb facs="tcp:66439:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>own Life; his Exhortation to Philoſophy, with ſeveral other works in Proſe; his Book of Hexameters and another of Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grams, all conſider'd together may equal him with the moſt Learned Princes in Story.</p>
            <p>Being thus arriv'd at the Higheſt Point of the <hi>Roman</hi> At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, it cannot be unpleaſant to look about us, and to take a ſhort ſurvey of the Productions in every Kind. Eloquence indeed will appear at ſome Diſtance, rather in the <hi>Auguſtan</hi> Age, than in <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his Reign, ending in <hi>Cicero,</hi> at the Diſſolution of the Common-Wealth. Not that his Death was properly the Ruine of his Profeſſion; for the Philoſopher might have liv'd much longer, and yet the Orator have been gone; when once the ancient Liberty was taken away, which inſpir'd him with all his lofty Thoughts, and was the very Soul of his Harangues. But then the Bounds of Hiſtory and Poeſy, were ſix'd under the Emperours Protection by <hi>Livy, Virgil</hi> and <hi>Horace.</hi> And if we deſire a view of Philoſophy, the two Poets will account for that as well as for their own Province.</p>
            <p>I think none will deny <hi>Horace</hi> the Elogy given him by a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated Writer, <hi>That he was the greateſt Maſter of Life, and of true Sence in the Conduct of it</hi>

            <p>After <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Muſes as well as the Eagles ſtoop'd from their former Height: and perhaps one of theſe Misfortunes might be a neceſſary Conſequence of the other. I am very ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry when I find either of them attributed to the Change of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the Settlement of the Monarchy. For had the Maxims and the Example of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> been purſue'd by his Succeſſors, the Empire in probability might have been much more Glorious than the Common-Wealth. But while a new Scheme of Politicks was introduc'd by <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and the <hi>Caeſars</hi> began to Act what the <hi>Tarquins</hi> wou'd have been aſham'd of, the Learning might very well be corrupted, together with the Manners and the Diſcipline, and all beyond any Hopes of a Recovery.</p>
            <p>It cannot be deny'd that ſome of the worſt Princes were the moſt paſſionate affecters of Learning, particularly <hi>Tiberius, Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> and <hi>Nero:</hi> But this rather deterr'd other Men from ſuch Attempts, than encourag'd them in their Purſuits; while an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded Scholar was as much envied, as a fortunate Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and a Rival in Wit, accounted as dangerous as a Contender for the Empire: The firſt being certainly the more hardy Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, who dar'd Challenge his Maſters at their own Weapons.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:66439:11"/>
            <p>Whatever Eſſays were made to recover the languiſhing Arts under <hi>Veſpaſian, Titus,</hi> and <hi>Domitian</hi> (for this laſt too was an encourager of Poeſy, tho' he baniſh'd the Philoſophers) ſcarce ſerv'd to any better Purpoſe, than to demonſtrate the poor Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Study and Application, while the ancient Genius was wanting.</p>
            <p>In the Six next Reigns, immediately following <hi>Domitian,</hi> Learning ſeems to have enjoy'd a ſort of lucid Interval, and the Baniſh'd Favourite was again admitted to Court, being highly countenanc'd and applauded by the beſt ſet of Princes <hi>Rome</hi> ever ſaw.</p>
            <p>Not to enquire after the Productions of the other Reigns, the uſeful Labours of <hi>Tacitus, Suetonius</hi> and <hi>Pliny Junior</hi> will make the Government of <hi>Trajan</hi> more famous than all his Feats of Arms. If they are leſs happy in their Language than the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, in other reſpects perhaps they have over-march'd them. The Hiſtorians in the delicacy of their Politicks, and the ſincere Truth of their Relations; and the Orator in his Wit and good Sence. If we add to theſe <hi>Plutarch,</hi> who wrote moſt of his Works in <hi>Rome,</hi> and was honour'd by <hi>Trajan</hi> with the Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and <hi>Quinctilian</hi> who flouriſh'd a very little Time before; they may paſs for the Twilight of Learning after the Sun-ſet of the <hi>Auguſtan</hi> Age; or rather be reſembled to a glimmering Taper which caſts a double Light when its juſt on the Point of Expiring.</p>
            <p>'Tis an Obſervation of Sir <hi>William Temple,</hi> that all the <hi>Latin</hi> Books which we have 'till the End of <hi>Trajan,</hi> and all the <hi>Greek</hi> 'till the End of <hi>Marcus Antoninus,</hi> have a true and very eſteema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Value; but that all written ſince that time, owe their Price purely to our Curioſity, and not to their own Worth and Excellence.</p>

            <p>Thus the <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> flock'd in Multitudes both to the Army and the City, after the reducing of thoſe Parts by <hi>Julius Caeſar, Auguſtus</hi> and <hi>Tiberius;</hi> as many <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Syrians</hi> had done before on the like account.

            <p>
               <hi>Quinctilian</hi> (or <hi>Tacitus</hi>) in the Dialogue <hi>de Oratoribus,</hi> gives an excellent Account of the old way of breeding Children and ſets it off with great Advantage, by comparing it with the Modern.</p>
            <q>
               <p>As ſoon as the Child was born, he was not given in charge to an hir'd Nurſe, to live with her in ſome pitiful Hole that ſerv'd for her Lodgings; but was brought up in the Lap and Boſom of the Mother, who reckon'd it among her chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations to keep the Houſe, and to wait on the Children. Some ancient Matron was pitch'd on out of the Neighbours, (whoſe Life and Manners rendred her worthy of that Office) to whoſe Care the Children of every Family were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: Before whom 'twas reckon'd the moſt hainous thing in the World to ſpeak an ill Word, or to do an ill Action. Nor had ſhe an Eye only on their Inſtruction, and the Buſineſs that they were to follow, but with an equal Modeſty and Gravity ſhe regulated their very Divertiſements and Recreations. Thus <hi>Cornelia, Aurelia</hi> and <hi>Attia,</hi> Mothers to the <hi>Grachi, Julius Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Auguſtus</hi> are reported to have undertaken the Office
<pb facs="tcp:66439:13"/>of Governeſſes, and to have imploy'd themſelves in the Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Noblemens Children. The ſtrictneſs and ſeverity of ſuch an Inſtitution had this very good Deſign, that the Mind being thus preſerv'd in its primitive Innocence and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, and not debauch'd by ill Cuſtom or ill Example might apply its ſelf with the greateſt willingneſs to the Liberal Arts, and embrace them with all its Powers and Faculties. That whether it was particularly inclin'd either to the Profeſſion of Arms, or to the underſtanding of the Law, or to the practice of Eloquence, it might make that its only Buſineſs, and greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drink in the whole Knowledge of the belov'd Study.</p>
               <p>But now the young Infant is given in charge to ſome poor <hi>Graecian</hi>'s Wench, and one or two of the Serving-Men perhaps are join'd in the Commiſſion; generally the meaneſt and moſt ill-bred of the whole Pack, and ſuch as are unfit for any ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Buſineſs. From the Stories and Tattle of ſuch fine Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, the ſoft and flexible Nature muſt take its firſt Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and bent. Over the whole Family there is not the leaſt Care taken of what is ſaid or done before the Child: while the very Parents inſtead of inuring their dear little Ones to Vertue and Modeſty, accuſtom them on the quite contrary, to Licentiouſneſs and wantonneſs, the natural reſult of which is a ſettled Impudence, and a contempt of thoſe very Parents, and every Body elſe.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Thus, altho' the Care and Inſtruction of Youth, among the old <hi>Romans,</hi> had been provided for by the publick Laws, as in the <hi>Spartan</hi> State, yet the voluntary Diligence of Parents would have made all ſuch Regulations uſeleſs.</p>
            <p>Among the domeſtick Cares, it will not be from the Purpoſe to take particular Notice of one, which requir'd little Trouble or Difficulty, and yet prov'd as Beneficial and Serviceable as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Inſtitution. I mean the uſing Children to ſpeak the Language purely at firſt; by letting them hear nothing but the trueſt and moſt proper Phraſe. By this only Advantage, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Perſons arriv'd at no ordinary Repute in the <hi>Forum,</hi> who were ſo unhappy to want many other Qualifications.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tully</hi> Says that the <hi>Gracchi</hi> were educated, <hi>non tam in gremio, quàm in ſermone matris:</hi> And he reports of <hi>C. Curio,</hi> who was reckon'd the third Orator of his time, that he underſtood no Poet, had read no Books of Eloquence, had made no Hiſtorical Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, and had no Knowledge of the publick or private Part of the Law. The only thing which gain'd him his Applauſe was
<pb facs="tcp:66439:14"/>a clean ſhining Phraſe, and a ſudden quickneſs and Fluency of Expreſſion.

               </gap> Love and Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the <hi>Forum,</hi> whence they were to expect the greateſt Share of their Honours and Preferments. For <hi>Cicero</hi> tells <hi>Atticus</hi> in his ſecond Book <hi>de Legibus,</hi> that when they were Boys they us'd to learn the famous Laws of the Twelve Tables by Heart, in the ſame Manner as they did any excellent Poem. And <hi>Plutarch</hi> relates in his Life of the Younger <hi>Cato,</hi> that the very Children had a Play in which they acted Pleadings of Cauſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Judges, accuſing one another and carrying the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd Party to Priſon.</p>
            <p>The Maſters already mention'd, together with the Inſtructors in the ſeveral ſorts of Manly Exerciſes, for the improving of their natural Strength and Force, do not properly deſerve that Name, if ſet in view with the Rhetoricians and Philoſophers; who, after that Reaſon had diſplay'd her Faculties, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd her command, were employ'd to cultivate and adorn the Advantages of Nature, and to give the laſt hand toward the forming of a <hi>Roman</hi> Citizen. Few Perſons made any great Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure on the Scene of Action in their own time, or in Hiſtory afterwards, who beſides the conſtant frequenting of Publick Lectures, did not keep with them in the Houſe ſome eminent Profeſſor of Oratory or Wiſdom.</p>
            <p>I have often thought that one main Reaſon of the prodigious Progreſs made by young Gentlemen, under theſe private Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, was the perfect Love and Endearment which we find to have been between Maſter and Scholar, by which means
<pb facs="tcp:66439:14"/>Government and Inſtruction proceeded in the ſweeteſt and eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt way. All Perſons in the happy Ages of <hi>Rome,</hi> had the ſame Honour and Reſpect for their Teachers, as <hi>Perſius</hi> had for his Maſter, <hi>Cornutus</hi> the <hi>Stoick,</hi> to whom addreſſing himſelf in his fifth Satire, he thus admirably deſcribes his own Love and Piety to his Governour, and the ſtrict Friendſhip that was between them.</p>

            <p>At the Age of Seventeen Years, the young Gentlemen, when they put on their manly Gown, were brought in a ſolemn Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to the <hi>Erum,</hi> and entered in the Study of Pleading: Not only if they deſign'd to make this their chief Profeſſion, but altho' their Inclinations lay rather to the Camp. For we ſcarce meet with any famous Captain who was not a good ſpeaker; or any eminent Orator, who had not ſerv'd ſome time in the Army. Thus it was requiſite for all Perſons who had any Thoughts of riſing in the World, to make a good Appearance both at the Bar and in the Field; becauſe, if the ſucceſs of their Valour and Conduct ſhou'd advance them to any conſiderable Poſt, it wou'd have prov'd almoſt impoſſible without the Advantage of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, to maintain their Authority with the Senate and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Or if the Force of their Oratory ſhou'd in time procure them the honourable Offices of <hi>Praetor</hi> or <hi>Conſul,</hi> they wou'd not have been in a Capacity to undertake the Government of
<pb facs="tcp:66439:15"/>the Provinces (which fell to their Share, at the Expiration of theſe Employments) without ſome experience in Military Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
            <p>Yet becauſe the Profeſſion of Arms was an Art, which wou'd eaſily give them an Opportunity of Signalizing themſelves, and in which they wou'd almoſt Naturally excel, as Occaſions ſhou'd be afterwards offer'd for their Service; their whole applications and Endeavours were directed at preſent to the Study of Law and Rhetorick, as the Foundation of their future Grandeur. Or perhaps they now and then made a Campaign, as well for a Diverſion from ſeveral Labours, as for their Improvement in Martial Diſcipline.</p>
            <p>In the Dialogue <hi>de Oratoribus,</hi> we have a very good Account of the Admiſſion of young Gentlemen to the <hi>Forum,</hi> and of the neceſſity of ſuch a Courſe in the Common-Wealth; which coming from ſo great a Maſter cannot fail to be very Pertinent and Inſtructive.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Among our Anceſtors (ſays that Author) the Youth who was deſign'd for the <hi>Forum,</hi> and the Practice of Eloquence, being now furniſh'd with the Liberal Arts, and the Advantages of a Domeſtick Inſtitution, was brought by his Father, or near Relations, to the moſt celebrated Orator in the City. Him he us'd conſtantly to attend, and to be always preſent at his perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of any Kind, either in judicial Matters, or in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Aſſemblies of the People: So that by this Means he learnt to engage in the Quarrels and Contentions of the Bar, and to approve himſelf a Man at Arms, in the Wars of the Pleaders.</p>
               <p>For in that ancient Conſtitution of a mixt State, when the Differences were never referr'd to one ſupream Perſon, the Orators determin'd Matters as they pleas'd, by prevailing on the Minds of the ignorant Multitude. Hence came the Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Popular Applauſe; hence the great variety of I aws and Decrees; hence the tedious Speeches and Harangues of the Magiſtrates, ſometimes carried on whole Nights in the <hi>Roſtra:</hi> Hence the frequent Indictment and Impleading of the moſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Criminals, and the expoſing of Houſes to the Violence and Fury of the Rabble: hence the Factions of the Nobility, and the conſtant Heats and Bickerings between the Senate and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. All which, tho' in a great Meaſure they Diſtracted the Common-Wealth, yet had this good Effect, that they exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd and improv'd the Eloquence of thoſe times, by propoſing the higheſt Rewards to that Study. Becauſe the more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

               </gap> in their Judgments, concerning the neceſſary Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb facs="tcp:66439:16"/>of an accompliſh'd Orator. The former denies any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the Honour of this Name, who does not poſſeſs in ſome Degree all the Qualities both native and acquir'd, that enter into the Compoſition of a general Scholar. The Force of his Argument lies in this, That an Orator ought to be able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver himſelf copiouſly on all manner of Subjects: And he does not ſee how any one can anſwer this Character, without ſome Excellency in all the Myſteries of Arts and Learning, as well as in the happy Endowments of Nature. Yet he wou'd not have theſe Acquiſitions ſet ſo looſe about him, as to be laid open to the Bottom on every Occaſion; but that (as a great Man expreſſeth it) they ſhou'd rather be ennamel'd in his Mind, than emboſs'd upon it. That as the Criticks in Gates and Geſtures will eaſily diſcover by the Comportment of a Man's Body whether he has learnt to Dance, tho' he does not practiſe his Art in his ordinary Motion: So an Orator when he delivers himſelf on any Subject, will eaſily make it appear whether he has a full Underſtanding of the particular Art or Faculty on which the Cauſe depends, tho' he does not diſcourſe of it in the Manner of a Philoſopher or a Mechanick. <hi>Antonius</hi> on the other Hand, reflecting on the ſhortneſs of Humane Life, and how great a part of it is commonly taken up in the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of but a few Parts of Knowledge, is inclin'd to believe that Oratory does not require the neceſſary Attendance of its Siſter Arts. But that a Man may be able to proſecute a Theme of any Kind, without a Train of Sciences, and the Advantages of a learned Inſtitution. That, as few Perſons are to ſeek in the cultivating of their Land, or the contrivance and elegance of their Gardens, tho' they never read <hi>Cato de Re Ruſticâ,</hi> or <hi>Mago</hi> the <hi>Carthaginian:</hi> So an Orator may harangue with a great deal of Reaſon and Truth on a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject taken from any part of Knowledge, without any farther Acquaintance with the nicer Speculations, than his common Senſe and Underſtanding, improv'd by Experience and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, ſhall lead him. <q>For who ever (ſays he) when he comes to move the Affections of the Judges or People, ſtops at this, that he hath not Philoſophy enough to dive into the Firſt Springs of the Paſſions, and to diſcover their various Natures and Operations: Beſides, at this Rate we muſt quite lay aſide the Way of raiſing Pity in the Audience, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the miſery of a diſtreſs'd Party, or deſcribing (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) the Slavery which he endures: when Philoſophy tells us
<pb facs="tcp:66439:17"/>that a good Man can never be miſerable, and that Virtue is is always abſolutely free.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now as <hi>Cicero</hi> without doubt ſat himſelf for the Picture which in <hi>Craſſu:</hi> his Name he there draws of an Orator, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtrengthens his Argument by his own Example as well as his Judgment; ſo <hi>Antonius</hi> in the next Dialogue does not ſtick to own, that his former Aſſertion was rather taken up for the Sake of diſputing and of encountering his Rival, than to deliver the juſt Sentiments of his Mind. And therefore the gentile Education in the Politer Ages of <hi>Rome</hi> being wholly directed to the Bar, it ſeems probable that no part of uſeful Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge was omitted, for the improving and adorning of the main Study; and that all the other Arts were courted, tho' not with an equal Paſſion. And upon the whole it appears, that a ſtrange Aſſiduity and unwearied Application, were the very Life and Soul of their Deſigns.

            <p>To confirm the Opinion of their extream Induſtry and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Study and Labour, it may not ſeem impertinent to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the Three common Exerciſes of Tranſlating, Declaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Reciting.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:66439:17"/>
            <p>Tranſlation the ancient Orators of <hi>Rome</hi> look'd on as a moſt uſeful, tho' a moſt laborious Employment. All Perſons that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied themſelves to the Bar, propos'd commonly ſome one Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of <hi>Greece</hi> for their conſtant Patern; either <hi>Lyſias, Hyperides, Demoſthenes</hi> or <hi>AEſchines,</hi> as their Genius was inclin'd. Him they continually ſtudied, and to render themſelves abſolutely Maſters of his Excellencies, were always making him ſpeak their own Tongue. This <hi>Cicero, Quinctilian,</hi> and <hi>Pliny Junior</hi> enjoin as an indiſpenſible Duty in order to the acquiring any Talent in Eloquence. And the firſt of theſe great Men, beſides his many Verſions of the Orators for his private uſe; oblig'd the Publick with the Tranſlation of ſeveral Parts of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Zenophon</hi> in Proſe, and <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Aratas</hi> in Verſe.</p>
            <p>As to Declaiming, this was not only the main Thing, at which they labour'd under the Maſters of Rhetorick, but what they practis'd long after they undertook real Cauſes, and had gain'd a conſiderable Name in the <hi>Forum. Suetonius</hi> in his Book <hi>of famous Rhetoricians,</hi> tells us that <hi>Cicero</hi> declaim'd in <hi>Greek</hi> 'till he was elected <hi>Praetor,</hi> and in <hi>Latin</hi> 'till near the time of his Death. That <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great, juſt at the breaking out of the Civil War, reſum'd his old Exerciſe of declaiming, that he might the more eaſily be able to deal with <hi>Curio,</hi> who undertook the Defence of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Cauſe in his Publick Harangues. That <hi>Marc Antony</hi> and <hi>Auguſtus</hi> did not lay aſide this Cuſtom, even when they were engag'd in the Seige of <hi>Mutina:</hi> And that <hi>Nero</hi> was not only conſtant at his Declamations, while in a private Station, but for the firſt Year after his Advancement to the Empire.</p>
            <p>It is worth remarking, that the Subject of theſe old Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations was not a meer fanciful Theſis, but a Caſe which might probably be brought into the Courts of Judicature. The contrary Practice, which crept into ſome Schools after the <hi>Auguſtan</hi> Age, to the great debaſing of Eloquence, is what <hi>Petronius</hi> inveighs ſo ſeverely againſt in the beginning of his <hi>Satyricon,</hi> in a Strain ſo Elegant that it wou'd loſe a great Part of the Grace and Spirit in any Tranſlation.</p>
            <p>When I ſpeak of Recitation, I intend not to inſiſt on the Publick Performances of the Poets in that kind, for which purpoſe they commonly borrow'd the Houſe of ſome of their Nobleſt Patrons, and carried on the whole Matter before a vaſt concourſe of People, and with abundance of Ceremony. For,
<pb facs="tcp:66439:18"/>conſidering the ordinary Circumſtances of Men of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, this may be thought not ſo much the Effect of an induſtrious Temper, as the neceſſary way of raiſing a Name among the Wits, and getting a tolerable Livelihood. And 'tis evident that under ſome Princes the moſt celebrated of this Tribe, for all their Trouble and Pains in proclaiming their Parts to the Multitude, cou'd hardly keep themſelves from ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: as <hi>Juvenal</hi> obſerves of <hi>Statius,</hi>

            <p>I wou'd mean therefore the Rehearſal of all, manner of Compoſitions in Proſe or Verſe perform'd by Men of ſome Rank and Quality, before they oblig'd the World with their Publication.

               </gap>intance, and now and then with the admiſſion of a more numerous Audience. The Deſign they chiefly aim'd at, was the correction and improvement of the Piece. For the Author having a greater Awe and Concern upon him on theſe Occaſions, than at other times, muſt needs take more Notice of every Word and Sentence, while he ſpoke them before the Company, than he did in the firſt Compoſure, or in the common Superviſals. Beſides, he had the Advantage of all his Friends Judgments, whether intimated to him afterwards in private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, or racitely declar'd at the Recital by their Looks and Nods, with many other Tokens of Diſlike or Approbation, In the fuller Auditories he had the Benefit of ſeeing what took, or what did not with the People; whoſe common Suffrage was of ſo great Authority in this Caſe, that <hi>Pomponius Secundus</hi> a celebrated Author of Tragedies, when he conſulted with his Friends about the poliſhing any of his Writings, if they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to differ in their Opinion about the Elegance, Juſtneſs, and Propriety of any Thought or Expreſſion, us'd always to ſay, <hi>AD POP<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>L<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>M PROVOCO, I APPEAL TO THE PEOPLE;</hi> as the beſt deciders of the Controverſy<note n="(k)" place="bottom">

            <p>The Example of the younger <hi>Pliny</hi> in this practice is very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, and the account which we have of it is given us by himſelf. <hi>I omit</hi> (ſays lie) <hi>no Way or Method that may ſeem Proper for correction: And firſt I take a ſtrict View of what I have Written, and conſider thoroughly of the whole Piece.

If I am in any doubt concerning their Criticiſms, I take in the aſſiſtance of one or two beſides my ſelf to judge and debate the Matter. Laſt of all, I recite before a greater Number; And this is the Time that I furniſh my ſelf with the Several Emen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations</hi>

            <p>It might be a farther Pleaſure on this Subject to deſcribe the whole Inſtitution and Courſe of Study of the moſt famous <hi>Romans,</hi> with their gradual Advances to thoſe Vertues and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments which we ſtill admire in their Story. But the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count which <hi>Cicero</hi> gives of himſelf in his <hi>Brutus,</hi> and ſome hints from other Parts of his Works, will excuſe, if not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, the omiſſion of all the reſt. And it is no ordinary Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs that we are oblig'd with the Hiſtory of that excellent Perſon from his own Hand, whom we muſt certainly pitch upon for the firſt and greateſt Example, if we were beholden only to the Relations of other Men.</p>
            <p>For ſome while after his Admiſſion to the <hi>Forum</hi> he was a conſtant Auditor of the beſt Pleaders when ever they ſpoke in Publick: every Day he ſpent ſome time in writing, reading and improving his Invention; beſides the Exerciſes he perform'd in the Art of Oratory. For the Knowledge of the Civil Law he applied himſelf with all imaginable Diligence to <hi>Q. Scaevola,</hi> the moſt celebrated Profeſſor of that Science; who tho' he did not make it his Buſineſs to procure Scholars, yet was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ready and willing to aſſiſt ſuch Perſons in this Study as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd his Advice and Directions. 'Twas to this <hi>Scaevola</hi> that <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Father when he put him on his <hi>Manly Gown,</hi> committed his Son, with a ſtrict Charge never to ſtir from him, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on extraordinary Accounts.</p>
            <p>About the 19th Year of his Age, in the Heat of the Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, between <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Sylla,</hi> when the Courts of Judicature were ſhut up, and all things in Confuſion; <hi>Philo</hi> the Prince
<pb facs="tcp:66439:19"/>of the <hi>Academy,</hi> leaving <hi>Athens</hi> on occaſion of the <hi>Mithridatick</hi> War, took up his Reſidence in <hi>Rome. Cicero</hi> wholly reſign'd himſelf to his Inſtitution, having now fix'd the bent of his Thoughts and Inclinations to Philoſophy, to which he gave the more diligent Attendance, becauſe the diſtraction of the Times gave him little Reaſon to hope that the old judicial Proceſs, and the regular Courſe of the Laws, wou'd ever be reſtor'd to their ſormer Vigour. Yet not entirely to forſake his Oratory, at the ſame time he made his Applications to <hi>Molo</hi> the <hi>Rhodian,</hi> a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Pleader and Maſter of Rhethorick.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sylla</hi> being now the ſecond time advanc'd againſt <hi>Mithridates,</hi> the City was not much diſturb'd with Arms for Three Years together. During this Interval, <hi>Cicero,</hi> with unwearied Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, made his Advances Day and Night in all manner of Learning; having now the Benefit of a New Inſtructor <hi>Diodotus</hi> the <hi>Stoic,</hi> who liv'd and died in his Houſe. To this Maſter beſides his improvement in other uſeful Parts of Knowledge, he was particularly oblig'd for keeping him continually exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd in Logick, which he calls <hi>a conciſe and compact kind of Eloquence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But tho' engag'd at the ſame time in ſo many and ſuch dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Faculties, he let no Day ſlip without ſome performance in Oratory: Declaiming conſtantly with the beſt Antagoniſts he cou'd light on among the Students. In this Exerciſe he did not ſtick to any one Language, but ſometimes made uſe of <hi>Latin,</hi> ſometimes of <hi>Greek;</hi> and indeed more frequently of the latter; either becauſe the Beauties and Ornaments of the <hi>Greek</hi> Style, wou'd by this means grow ſo Natural as eaſily to be imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated in his own Tongue: or becauſe his <hi>Graecian</hi> Maſters wou'd not be ſuch proper Judges of his Style and Method, nor ſo well able to correct his Failures, if he deliver'd himſelf in any other than their Native I anguage.</p>
            <p>Upon <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Victorious return and his Settlement of the Common-Wealth, the Lawyers recover'd their Practice, and the ordinary Courſe of judicial Matters was reviv'd. And then it was that <hi>Cicero</hi> came to the Bar, and undertook the Patronage of Publick and Private Cauſes. His firſt Oration in a <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Judgment,</hi> was the Defence of <hi>Sextus Reſcius,</hi> proſecuted by no leſs a Man than the <hi>Diclator</hi> himſelf, which was the Reaſon that none of the old ſtanch Advocates dar'd appear in his behalf. <hi>Cicero</hi> carried the Cauſe, to his great Honour, being now about Six or Seven and Twenty: And having
<pb facs="tcp:66439:19"/>behav'd himſelf ſo remarkably well in his firſt Enterprize, there was no Buſineſs thought too weighty or difficult for his management.</p>
            <p>He found himſelf at this time to labour under a very weak Conſtitution, to which was added the Natural Default in his make of a long and thin Neck: ſo that in Probability the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and ſtraining of the Body requir'd in an Orator cou'd not conſiſt but with manifeſt Danger of his Life. This was eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to be fear'd in him, becauſe he was obſerv'd in his Pleadings to keep his Voice always at the higheſt Pitch in a moſt vehement and impetuous Tone, and at the ſame time to uſe an agreeable Violence in his Geſture and Action. Upon this Conſideration the Phyſicians and his neareſt Friends were continually urging him to lay aſide all thoughts of a Profeſſion which appear'd ſo extreamly prejudicial to his Health. But <hi>Cicero</hi> ſhow'd himſelf equally inflexible to the Advice of the one, and to the Entreaties of the other; and declar'd his Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on rather to run the riſque of any Danger that might happen, than deprive himſelf of the Glory which he might juſtly challenge from the Bar.</p>
            <p>Confirming himſelf in this Determination he began to think, that upon altering his Mode of ſpeaking and bringing his Voice down to a lower and more moderate Key, he might abate conſiderably of the Heat and Fury which now tranſported him, and by that Means avoid the Damage which ſeem'd now to threaten his Deſign.</p>
            <p>For the effecting of the Cure, he concluded on a Journey into <hi>Greece:</hi> And ſo, after he had made his Name very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in the <hi>Forum,</hi> by Two Years pleading, he left the City. Being arriv'd at <hi>Athens,</hi> he took up his Reſidence for Six Months with the Philoſopher <hi>Antiochus,</hi> the wiſeſt and moſt noble Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the old <hi>Academy:</hi> And here under the direction of the greateſt Maſter, he renew'd his Acquaintance with that Part of Learning which had been the conſtant Entertainment of his Youth: at the ſame time performing his Exerciſes in Orato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry under the Care of <hi>Demetrius</hi> the <hi>Syrian,</hi> and eminent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor of the Art of Speaking. After this he made a Circuit round all <hi>Aſia,</hi> with ſeveral of the moſt celebrated Orators and Rhetoricians, who voluntarily offer'd him their Company.</p>
            <p>But not ſatisfied with all theſe Advantages, he ſail'd to <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and there entred himſelf once more among the Scholars of the famous <hi>Molo,</hi> whom he had formerly heard at <hi>Rome:</hi> One

The greateſt part of <hi>Romulus</hi>'s time was taken up in making Laws and Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations for the Common-wealth: Three of his State-Deſigns, I mean the <hi>Aſylum,</hi> the Rape of the <hi>Sabine</hi> Virgins, and his way of treating thoſe few whom he conquer'd, as they far exceeded the Politicks of thoſe Times; ſo they contributed, in an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary degree, to an advancement of the New Empire.

               <p>THE Tyrant was no ſooner expell'd, but, as it uſually hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, there was great plotting and deſigning for his Reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.

Whereupon the Ambaſſadors going into the Town, and encouraging the <hi>Cluſians</hi> to a Sally, one of them was ſeen per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally engaging in the Action. This being contrary to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd Law of Nations, was reſented in ſo high a manner by the Enemy, that breaking up from before <hi>Cluſium,</hi> the whole Army march'd directly toward <hi>Rome.</hi> About eleven Miles from the City, they met with the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, Commanded by the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Tribunes, who, engaging without any Order or Diſcipline, receiv'd an entire Defeat. Upon the arrival of this ill News, the greateſt part of the Inhabitants immediately fled: Thoſe that reſolv'd to ſtay, fortified themſelves in the Capitol. The <hi>Gauls</hi> ſoon appear'd at the City-Gates; and deſtroying all with Fire and Sword, carry'd on the Siege of the Capitol with all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable Fury: At laſt, reſolving on a general Aſſault, they were diſcover'd by the Cackling of the Geeſe that were kept for that purpoſe; and as many as had climb'd the Rampart, were drove down by the valiant <hi>Manlius,</hi> when <hi>Camillus,</hi> ſetting upon them in the Rear with Twenty thouſand Men that he got together about the Country, gave them a total Overthrow. The greateſt part of thoſe that eſcap'd our of the Field, were cut off in ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Parties, by the Inhabitants of the Neighbouring Towns and Villages. The City had been ſo entirely demoliſh'd, that upon the return of the People, they thought of removing to <hi>Veii,</hi> a City ready built, and excellently provided of all Things. But being diverted from this Deſign, by an Omen, (as they thought) they ſet to the Work, with ſuch extraordinary Diligence and Application, that within the compaſs of a Year, the whole City was re-built. They had ſcarce gain'd a breathing-time after their Troubles, when the united Powers of the <hi>Aequi, Volſci,</hi> and other Inhabitants of <hi>Latium,</hi> at once invaded their Territories.

Upon this, a War was ſoon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menc'd between the States.

                  <hi>Antoninus Plus</hi> ſtudied more the defence of the Empire, than the Enlargement of it. However, his admirable Prudence, and ſtrict Reformation of Manners, rendred him perhaps as ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Commonwealth as the greateſt Conquerours.</p>
               <p>The Two <hi>Antonini, Marcus</hi> and <hi>Lucius,</hi> were they that made the firſt Diviſion of the Empire.

And perhaps this was the chief reaſon of the ill ſucceſs, which conſtantly attended that Emperour, in the Eaſtern Wars: For the <hi>Perſians</hi> were all along his Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours; and when at laſt a Peace was concluded, the Advantage of the Conditions laid on their ſide.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Julian,</hi> as he took effectual care for the ſecurity of the other Bounds of the Empire; ſo his Deſigns againſt the moſt formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Enemies, the <hi>Perſians,</hi> had all appearance of Succeſs; but that he loſt his Life before they could be fully put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jovian</hi> was no ſooner elected Emperour, but being under ſome apprehenſion of a Rival in the Weſt, he immediately ſtruck up a moſt diſhonourable Peace with the <hi>Perſians,</hi> at the Price of the famous City <hi>Niſibis,</hi> and all <hi>Meſopotamia.</hi> For which baſe Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as he does not fail of an Invective from every Hiſtorian; ſo particularly <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi>
                  <note n="(b)" place="bottom">Lib. 25.</note> and <hi>Zozimus,</hi> have taken the pains to ſhew, that he was the firſt <hi>Roman</hi> Governour who reſign'd up the leaſt part of their Dominions upon any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Firſt, hath generally the Character of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Prince: But he ſeems to have been more ſtudious of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging his Subjects, by an eaſie and quiet Government, than
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:66439:34"/>deſirous of acting any thing againſt the encroaching Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gratian</hi> too, tho' a Prince of great Courage and Experience in War, was able to do no more than to ſettle the ſingle Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Gaul:</hi> But he is extreamly applauded by Hiſtorians, for taking ſuch extraordinary care in the buſineſs of a Succeſſor: For being very ſenſible how every Day produc'd worſe Effects in the Empire; and that the State, if not at the laſt Gaſp, yet was very nigh, beyond all hopes of recovery, he made it his whole ſtudy to ſind out a Perſon that ſhould, in all Reſpects, be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citated for the noble Work of the Deliverance of his Country. The Man he pitch'd upon was <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> a Native of <hi>Spain;</hi> who, being now inveſted with the Command of the Eaſt, upon the death of <hi>Gratian,</hi> remain'd ſole Emperour. And, indeed, in a great meaſure he anſwer'd the Expectation of the World, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the moſt reſolute Defender of the Empire in its declining Age. But for his Collegue <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Second he was cut off, without having done any thing that deſerves our No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</p>
               <p>Under <hi>Honorius,</hi> things return'd to their former deſperate ſtate, the barbarous Nations getting ground on all ſides, and making e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day ſome diminution in the Empire; 'till at laſt, <hi>Alaric,</hi> King of the <hi>Goths,</hi> waſting all <hi>Italy,</hi> proceeded to <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contented to ſet a few Buildings on fire, and rifle the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuries, retir'd with his Army<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Paul.

And <hi>Nero</hi> is ſuppos'd to have done more Miſchief when he ſet it on fire in jeſt, than it now ſuffer'd from the barbarous Conquerour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Third, at his firſt Acceſſion to the Empire, gave great hopes of his proving the Author of a happy Revolution<note n="(d)" place="bottom">Pompon.

               <p>By this time, the State was given over as deſperate; and what Princes follow'd 'till the taking of the City by <hi>Odoacer,</hi> were only a company of miſerable, ſhort-liv'd Tyrants, remarkable for nothing but the Meanneſs of their Extraction, and the Poorneſs of their Government; ſo that Hiſtorians generally paſs them over in ſilence, or at moſt with the bare mention of their Names.

                     <q>Upon the 21ſt. of <hi>June,</hi> being a very clear Day, the whole Plott of Ground deſign'd for the Temple, was bound about with Fillers and Garlands. Such of the Soldiers as had lucky Names, entred firſt with Boughs in their Hands, taken from thoſe Trees which the Gods more eſpecially delighted in. Next came the <hi>Veſtal</hi> Virgins, with Boys and Girls whoſe Fathers and Mothers were living, and ſprinkled the Place with Brook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, River-water, and Spring-water. Then <hi>Helvidius Priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> the Praetor, (<hi>Plautus Elian,</hi> one of the Chief Prieſts, going before him) after he had perform'd the ſolemn Sacrifice of a Swine, a Sheep, and a Bullock, for the Purgation of the Floor, and laid the Entrails upon a green Turf, humbly beſought <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter, Juno, Minerva,</hi> and the other Deities, Protectors of the Empire, that they would be pleas'd to proſper their preſent Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, and accompliſh, by their Divine Aſſiſtance, what Human Piety had thus begun. Having concluded his Prayer, he put his Hand to the Fillets, to which the Ropes, with a great Stone faſtned in them, had been tied for this occaſion; when im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately the whole Company of Prieſts, Senators, Knights, with
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:66439:43"/>the greateſt part of the common People, laying hold together on the Rope, with all Expreſſions of Joy, drew the Stone into the Trench deſign'd for the Foundation, throwing in Wedges of Gold, Silver, and other Metals, which had never endur'd the Fire.</q>

                  <p>Some curious Perſons have obſerv'd this Similitude between the Shape of theſe old Temples, and our modern Churches: That they had one Apartment more holy than the reſt, which they term'd <hi>Cella,</hi> anſwering to our Chancel or Choire: That the Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co's in the ſides, were in all reſpects like to our Iſles; and that our <hi>Navis,</hi> or Body of the Church, is an imitation of their <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilica</hi>

                  <p>There are two other Temples particularly worth our notice; not ſo much for the Magnificence of the Structure, as for the Cuſtoms that depend upon them, and the remarkable Uſe to which they were put. Theſe are the Temples of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Janus.</hi>

                        <hi>Plutarch</hi> in Problem.</note>. But perhaps there might be no more in't, than that this Temple was one of the ſtrongeſt Places in the City, and ſo the fitteſt for that uſe. Here were preſerv'd all the Publick Regiſters and Records, among which were the <hi>Libri Elephantini,</hi> or great Ivory Tables, contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a Liſt of all the <hi>Tribes,</hi> and the Schemes of the Publick Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.</p>
                  <p>The other was a ſquare Piece of Building (ſome ſay of entire Braſs) ſo large as to contain a Statue of <hi>Janus</hi> five foot high; with brazen Gates of each ſide, which us'd always to be kept open in War, and ſhut in time of Peace<note n="(w)" place="bottom">Vid. <hi>Marhan.</hi> Topog. <hi>Rom.</hi> Antiq. lib. 3. cap. 8.</note>.</p>

                  <p>The Superſtition of conſecrating Groves and Woods to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Deities, was a practice very uſual with the Ancients: For, not to ſpeak of thoſe mention'd in the Holy Scripture, <hi>Pliny</hi> aſſures us, That <hi>Trees in old time ſerv'd for the Temples of the Gods. Tacitus</hi> reports this cuſtom of the old <hi>Germans; Q.

                  <p>The moſt probable reaſon that can be given for this practice, is taken from the common Opinion, That Fear was the main Principle of Devotion among the ignorant Heathens. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch darkſom and lonely Seats, putting them into a ſudden Horrour and Dread, made them fanſie that there muſt neceſſarily ſomething of Divinity inhabit here, which cou'd produce in them ſuch an Awe and Reverence at their Entrance.</p>

                  <p>Arches were publick Buildings, deſign'd for the reward and encouragement of noble Enterprizes, erected generally to the Honour of ſuch eminent Perſons as had either won a Victory of extraordinary conſequence abroad, or had reſcu'd the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth at home from any conſiderable danger. At firſt they were plain and rude Structures, by no means remarkable for Beauty or State. But in later times no Expences were thought too great for the rendring them in the higheſt manner ſplendid and magnificent: No thing being more uſual than to have the greateſt Actions of the Heroes they ſtood to Honour curiouſly expreſs'd, or the whole Proceſſion of the Triumph cut out on the ſides.

                  <p>As to their Figure, they were at firſt ſemicircular, whence probably they took their Names. Afterwards they were built
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:66439:53"/>four-ſquare, with a ſpacious arched Gate in the middle, and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ones on each ſide.

                  <p>The Columns or Pillars were none of the meaneſt Beauties of the City.

They run naked, becauſe <hi>Pan</hi> is always painted ſo.

                  <p>Some have fanſied with <hi>Plutarch,</hi> that theſe <hi>Lupercalia</hi> were inſtituted in Honour of the Wolf that preſerv'd <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus.</hi> Others carry their Original much higher, and tell us, that they were brought into <hi>Italy</hi> by <hi>Evander,</hi> before the time of <hi>Aeneas.</hi>

                  <p>After the killing of <hi>Cacus,</hi> a Gyant that had ſtole ſome of <hi>Hercules</hi> his Cattle away, the Booty that he brought through <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>

The performance of theſe Rites he committed to the care of the <hi>Potitii</hi> and <hi>Pinarii,</hi> two of the nobleſt Families, and of beſt repute in thoſe parts. There goes a Story, that the <hi>Pinarii</hi> happening to come too late to the Sacrifice, ſo as to loſe their ſhare in the Entrails, they were, by way of puniſhment, debarr'd from ever taſting them for the future: And hence ſome derive their Name from <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="2">2. From Birds; whence they had the Name of <hi>Auſpices,</hi> of <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis</hi> and <hi>conſpicio.</hi> Some Birds furniſh'd them with Obſervations from their chattering or ſinging, others from their flying.

                  <p>For the taking of both theſe ſort of <hi>Auguries,</hi> the Obſerver ſtood upon a Tower with his Head cover'd in a Gown peculiar to his Office, call'd <hi>

                  <p n="3">3. From Chickens kept in a Coop or Pen for this purpoſe. The manner of divining from them was as follows: Betimes in the Morning the <hi>Augur</hi> that was to make the Obſervation, call'd from hence <hi>Pullarius,</hi> (tho' perhaps the Keeper of the Chickens had rather that Name,) in the firſt place commanding a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Silence, order'd the Pen to be open'd, and threw down a handful of Crumbs or Corn. If the Chickens did not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately run fluttering to the Meat; if they ſcatter'd it with their Wings; if they went by without taking notice of it, or if they flew away, the Omen was reckon'd unfortunate, and to por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend nothing but danger or miſchance: But if they leap'd pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently out of the Pen and fell to ſo greedily as to let ſome of their Meat drop out of their Mouths upon the Pavement, there was all the aſſurance in the World of Happineſs and Succeſs<note n="(f)" place="bottom">Idem, lib. 1. cap <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="4">4. From Beaſts. Theſe, as <hi>Rofinus</hi> reckons them up, were Wolves, Foxes, Goats, Heifers, Aſſes, Rams, Hares, Weeſels, and Mice. The general Obſervations about them were, Whether they appear'd in a ſtrange place, or croſs'd the way; or, whether they run to the Right or the Left, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

The buſineſs of the <hi>Haru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpices</hi> was to look upon the Beaſts offer'd in Sacrifice, and by them to divine the ſucceſs of any Enterprize. They took their Obſervations from Four Appearances.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. From the Beaſts before they were cut up.</item>
                     <item>2. From the Entrails of thoſe Beaſts after they were cut up.</item>
                     <item>3. From the Flame that us'd to riſe when they were burning.</item>
                     <item>4. From the Flower or Bran, from the Frankincenſe, Wine and Water that they us'd in the Sacrifice.</item>
                  </list>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:66439:62"/>
                  <p>In the Beaſts, before they were cut up, they took notice, Whether they were forc'd to be dragg'd to the Altar; Whether they got looſe out of the Leader's Hands; Whether they eſcap'd the the ſtroke, or bounded up, and roar'd very loud when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd it; Whether they died with a great deal of difficulty; all which, with ſeveral other Omens, were counted unfortunate: Or whether, on the other ſide, they follow'd the Leader with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Compulſion; receiv'd the Blow without ſtruggling and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance; Whether they died eaſily, and ſent out a great quantity of Blood, which gave the like aſſurance of a proſperous event.</p>
                  <p>In the Beaſt, when cut up, they obſerv'd the colour of the parts, and whether any were wanting. A double Liver was counted highly unfortunate: A little, or a lean Heart was always unlucky: If the Heart was wholly miſſing, nothing could be thought more fatal and dreadful; as it happen'd in Two Oxen together, offer'd by <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> a little before his Murder; if the Entrails fell out of the Prieſts Hands; if they were dawb'd more than ordinary with Blood; if they were of a pale livid co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, they portended ſudden danger and ruin.</p>
                  <p>As to the Flame of the Sacrifice, it furniſh'd them with a good Omen if it gather'd up violently, and preſently conſum'd the Sacrifice: If it was clear, pure, and tranſparent, without any mixture of Smoak, and not diſcolour'd with red, pale, or black; if it was quiet and calm, not ſparkling or crackling, but run up directly in the ſhape of a Pyramid. On the contrary it always portended Misfortunes, if at firſt it requir'd much pains to light it; if it did not burn upright, but rowl'd into Circles, and left void ſpaces between them; if it did not preſently catch hold on the whole Sacrifice, but crept up by degrees, from one part to another; if it happen'd to be ſpread about by the Wind, or to be put out by ſudden Rain, or to leave any part uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd.</p>
                  <p>In the Meal Frankincenſe, Wine and Water, they were to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, whether they had their due quantity, their proper taſte, colour, and ſmell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There were ſeveral leſſer Signs which ſupplied them with Conjectures too inſignificant to be here mention'd.</p>

                  <p>THE firſt of theſe Orders, famous only on account of the Relicks they preſerv'd, owe their Original to this occaſion. A ſtrange old Woman came once to <hi>Tarquinius Superbus</hi> with Nine Books; which, ſhe ſaid, were the Oracles of the <hi>Sibyls,</hi> and proffer'd to ſell them. But the King making ſome ſcruple about the price, ſhe went away, and burnt Three of them; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning with the Six, ask'd the ſame Summ as before. <hi>Tarquin</hi> only laugh'd at the Humour: Upon which the old Woman left him once more; and after ſhe had burnt Three others, came again with them that were left, but ſtill kept to her old Terms. The King begun now to wonder at her obſtinacy, and thinking there might be ſomething more than ordinary in the Buſineſs, ſent for the <hi>Augurs</hi> to conſult what was to be done. They, when their Divinations were perform'd, ſoon acquainted him what a piece of Impiety he had been guilty of, by refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a Treaſure ſent to him from Heaven, and commanded him to give whatever ſhe demanded for the Books that remain'd. The Woman receiv'd her Money, and deliver'd the Writings; and only charging them by all means to keep them Sacred, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately vaniſh'd. Two of the Nobility were preſently after choſe to be the Keepers of theſe Oracles, which were laid up with all imaginable care in the <hi>Capitol,</hi> in a Cheſt under Ground. They could not be conſulted without a ſpecial Order of the Senate, which was never granted, unleſs upon the receiving ſome nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble defeat, upon the riſing of any conſiderable Mutiny, or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in the State, or upon ſome other extraordinary occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note n="(a)" place="bottom">

                  </head>
                  <p>THE Word <hi>Sacrificium</hi> more properly ſignifies the Thing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd, than the action of Offering. The two common Words to expreſs the former, were <hi>Victima</hi> and <hi>Hoſtia;</hi> which though they are very often confounded, yet by the firſt Word are properly meant the greater ſort of Sacrifices, by the other the leſs.</p>
                  <p>Tho' every Deity had ſome peculiar Rites and Inſtitutions, and conſequently different ſorts of Sacrifices, in which the greateſt part of the publick Worſhip then conſiſted; yet there were ſome ſtanding Rules and Ceremonies to be obſerv'd in all.</p>
                  <p>The Prieſt (and ſometimes the Perſon that gave the Victim) went before in a white Garment free from all Spots and Figures: For <hi>Cicero</hi> tells us, that White is the moſt acceptable Colourt the Gods; I ſuppoſe becauſe it ſeems to denote Purity and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.</p>
                  <p>The Beaſt to be ſacrific'd, if 'twas of the larger ſort, us'd to be mark'd on the Horns with Gold; if of the leſſer ſort, it was crown'd with the Leaves of that Tree which the Deity was thought moſt to delight in, for whom the Sacrifice was deſign'd. And beſides theſe, they wore the <hi>Infula</hi> and <hi>Vittae,</hi> a ſort of white Fillets about their Head.</p>

                  <p>THE way that the <hi>Romans</hi> us'd to reckon the Days of their Months was by the Kalends, Nones, and Ides. <hi>Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> begun his Months always upon the firſt day of the new Moon, and was follow'd in this by the Authors of the other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts to avoid the altering of the immoveable Feaſts. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every new Moon one of the inferiour Prieſts us'd to aſſemble the People in the Capitol, and <hi>call</hi> over as many Days as there were between that and the Nones: And ſo from the old Word <hi>Calo,</hi> or the <hi>Greek</hi>

                     </gap>, to call, the firſt of theſe Days had the Name of <hi>Kalendae.</hi> But we muſt remember, that this cuſtom of <hi>calling</hi> the Days continu'd no longer than the Year of the City 450, when <hi>C. Flavius</hi> the <hi>Curule Aedile,</hi> order'd the <hi>Faſti,</hi> or Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar, to be ſet up in publick Places, that every Body might know the difference of times, and the return of the Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals<note n="(a)" place="bottom">

                  <p>The Nones were ſo call'd becauſe they reckon'd Nine Days from them to the Ides.</p>
                  <p>The Ides were generally about the middle of the Month, and then we may derive the Word from <hi>iduare,</hi> an obſolete Verb, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying to divide.</p>
                  <p>The Kalends were always fixt to the firſt day of every Month; but the Nones and the Ides in Four Months were on different Days than in the other Eight. For <hi>March, May, July,</hi> and <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> had Six Nones a-piece, the other only Four. Therefore in the firſt the Nones were the 7th, and the Ides the 15th; in the laſt, the Nones the 5th, and the Ides the 13th.</p>
                  <p>In reckoning theſe they always went backwards. Thus <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi> 1. was the <hi>firſt of the Kalends</hi> of <hi>January: December</hi> 31. <hi>Prid.

But afterwards, when the State grew rich and great, though all other good Offices continu'd between them, yet 'twas thought a diſhonourable thing for the better Sort to take any Money of their Inferiours<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Vide <hi>Dionyſ.</hi> lib. 2. <hi>Liv.</hi> lib. 1. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in <hi>Romulo.</hi>

                  <p>The Diviſion of the People into the three diſtinct Orders of <hi>Senators, Knights,</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> took its riſe about the time of <hi>Tarquin</hi>'s expulſion. The <hi>Senators</hi> were ſuch Perſons as had been promoted to ſit in the Supreme Council of State, either out of the <hi>Nobility</hi> or <hi>Commons.</hi> The <hi>Knights</hi> were ſuch Perſons as were allow'd a Gold-Ring and a Horſe at the Publick Charge. The <hi>Commons</hi> were all the reſt of the People, beſides theſe Two Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, including not only the inferiour Populacy, but ſuch of the Nobility too as had not yet been elected <hi>Senators,</hi> and ſuch of the Gentry as had not a compleat Knight's Eſtate: For Perſons were admitted into the two higher Ranks according to their Fortunes; one that was worth Eight hundred <hi>Seſtertia,</hi> was capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing choſe <hi>Senator;</hi> one that had Four hundred, might be taken into the <hi>Equeſtrian</hi> Order. <hi>Auguſtus</hi> afterwards alter'd the <hi>Senato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> State to Twelve thouſand <hi>Seſterces;</hi> but the <hi>Equeſtrian</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd the ſame.</p>
                  <p>When we find in <hi>Livy, Cicero,</hi> and other Authors, the <hi>Opti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates</hi> and <hi>Populares</hi> oppos'd as two contrary Parties; we muſt underſtand by the former ſuch Perſons of what Rank ſoever, who ſtood up for the Grandeur and Majeſty of the State. By the latter, any Perſons, of what Order ſoever, who were continually mutining againſt the Government, complaining of Encroachments, loſs of Liberty, and Privileges; and endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to bring all things to a Level.</p>
                  <p>There's another common Diviſion of the People into <hi>Nobiles, Novi,</hi> and <hi>Ignobiles,</hi> taken from the right of uſing Pictures, or Statues; an Honour only allow'd to ſuch whoſe Anceſtors or themſelves had bore ſome <hi>Curule</hi> Office; that is, had been <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule Aedile, Cenſor, Praetor,</hi> or <hi>Conſul.</hi> He that had the Pictures, or Statues, of his Anceſtors, was term'd <hi>Nobilis;</hi> he that had only his own, <hi>Novus;</hi> he that had neither, <hi>Ignobilis.</hi> So that <hi>Jus imaginis</hi> was much the ſame thing among them, as the Right of Bearing a Coat of Arms among us: And their <hi>Novus Homo</hi> is equivalent to our upſtart Gentleman.</p>
                  <p>Such Perſons as were free of the City, are generally diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd into <hi>Ingenui, Liberti,</hi> and <hi>Libertini.</hi> The <hi>Ingenui</hi> were ſuch as had been born free, and of Parents that had been always free. The <hi>Libertini</hi> were the Children of ſuch as had been made free. <hi>Liberti,</hi> ſuch as had been actually made free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>The two common Ways of conferring Freedom, were by <hi>Teſtament,</hi> and by <hi>Manumiſſion.</hi> A Slave was ſaid to be free by <hi>Teſtament,</hi> when his Maſter, in conſideration of his faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,

                  <p>The Ceremony of <hi>Manumiſſion</hi> was thus perform'd: The Slave was brought before the Conſul, and in after-times before the <hi>Praetor,</hi> by his Maſter, who laying his Hand upon his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant's Head, ſaid to the <hi>Praetor, Hunc hominem liberum eſſe volo;</hi> and with that, let him go out of his Hand, which they term'd <hi>è<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THE Chief Council of State, and, as it were, the Body of Magiſtrates, was the <hi>Senate;</hi> which as it has been generally reckon'd the Foundation and Support of the <hi>Roman</hi> Greatneſs; ſo it was one of the earlieſt Conſtitutions in the Republick: For <hi>Romulus</hi> firſt choſe out a Hundred Perſons of the beſt Repute for Birth, Wiſdom, and Integrity of Manners, to aſſiſt him in the Management of Affairs; with the Name of <hi>Senators,</hi> or <hi>Patres,</hi> from their Age and Gravity; a Title as Honourable, and yet as little ſubject to Envy, as could poſſibly have been pitch'd upon.

                  <p>As to the general Title of <hi>Patres Conſcripti</hi> given them in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, it was taken up as a mark of Diſtinction, proper to thoſe Senators who were added to <hi>Romulus</hi>'s Hundred, either by <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinius Priſcus,</hi> or by the People upon the eſtabliſhment of the Commonwealth: But in after-times, all the Number were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly ſtyl'd <hi>Patres,</hi> and <hi>Patres Conſcripti.</hi>

                  <p>When as many as thought fit had given their Judgements at large, the ſupreme Magiſtrate made a ſhort Report of their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Opinions; and then in order to paſſing the Decree, order'd the <hi>Senators</hi> to divide, one Party to one ſide of the Houſe, and the oppoſite to the other. The number being now told, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor part determin'd the Caſe; and a <hi>Senatus-conſultum</hi> was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly wrote by the publick Notaries at the feet of the Chief Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, being ſubſcrib'd by the principal Members that promoted it.</p>
                  <p>But in Caſes of little Concern, or ſuch as requir'd expedition, the formality of asking Opinions, and debating the Buſineſs, was laid aſide, and a Decree paſs'd upon the bare Diviſion of the Houſe, and the counting of the Numbers on both Sides.

                  <p>At the firſt inſtitution this Honour was confin'd to the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but in the Year of the City 387, the Commons obtain'd the Privilege of having one of their own Body always an Aſſociate in this Office.

                  <p>THE Office of <hi>Dictator</hi> was of very early Original: For the <hi>Latines</hi> entring on a Confederacy againſt <hi>Rome</hi> to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port <hi>Tarquin</hi>'s Cauſe after his Expulſion, the Senate were under great apprehenſions of danger, by reaſon of the difficulty they found in procuring Levies to oppoſe them. For the poorer Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, who had been forc'd to run themſelves into debt with the <hi>Patricians,</hi> abſolutely refus'd to liſt themſelves, unleſs an Order of Senate might paſs for a general Remiſſion. Now the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Life and Death being lately taken from the Conſuls by the <hi>Valerian</hi> Law, and liberty given for an Appeal from them to the People, they could not compel any body to take up Arms. Upon this account they found it neceſſary to create a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, who for Six Months ſhould rule with abſolute Authority
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:66439:81"/>even above the Laws themſelves. The firſt Perſon pitch'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for this Honour was <hi>Titus Largius Flavus,</hi> about <hi>A. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>. C.</hi> 253, or 255.<note n="(a)" place="bottom">

                  <p>This ſupreme Officer was call'd <hi>Dictator,</hi> either becauſe he was <hi>Dictus,</hi> named of the Conſul; or elſe, from Dictating and Commanding what ſhould be done<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.

                  <p>THE Original of this Office, inſtituted in the Year of the City 389. is owing to two occaſions: Partly becauſe the <hi>Conſuls</hi> being very often wholly taken up with foreign Wars, found the want of ſome Perſon to adminiſter Juſtice in the City; and partly becauſe the Nobility, having loſt their appropriation of the Conſulſhip, were ambitious of procuring to themſelves ſome new Honour in its room<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Vide <hi>Liv.</hi> lib. 7. <hi>circa princip.</hi>

                  <p>THE <hi>Cenſus,</hi> or Survey of the <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens and their Eſtates (from <hi>Cenſco,</hi> to <hi>rate,</hi> or <hi>value</hi>) was introduc'd by <hi>Servius Tullius,</hi> the ſixth King, but without the Aſſignment of any particular Officer to manage it: And therefore he took the trouble upon himſelf, and made it a part of the Regal Duty.
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:66439:83"/>Upon the expulſion of the <hi>Tarquins,</hi> the Buſineſs fell to the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls,</hi> and continu'd in their care, 'till their Dominions grew ſo large as to give them no leiſure for its performance. Upon this account it was wholly omitted ſeventeen years together, 'till <hi>A. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>. C.</hi> 311. when they found the neceſſity of a New Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate for that Employment, and thereupon created Two <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors:</hi> Their Office was to continue five Years, becauſe every fifth Year the General Survey of the People us'd to be perform'd: But when they grew to be the moſt conſiderable Perſons in the State, for fear they ſhould abuſe their Authority, <hi>A. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>. C.</hi> 420. a Law paſs'd, by which their Place was confin'd to a Year and a half; and therefore for the future, though they were elected every five Years, yet they continu'd to hold the Honour no longer than the time prefix'd by that Law.</p>
                  <p>After the ſecond <hi>Punick</hi> War, they were always created out of ſuch Perſons as had been <hi>Conſuls,</hi> though it ſometimes happen'd otherwiſe before. Their Station was reckon'd more Honourable than the <hi>Conſulſhip,</hi> though their Authority, in Matters of State, was not ſo conſiderable. And the Badges of the Two Offices were the ſame, only that the <hi>Cenſors</hi> were not allow'd the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi> to walk before them, as the <hi>Conſuls</hi> had.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lipſius</hi> divides the Duty of the <hi>Cenſors</hi> into two Heads; the Survey of the People, and the Cenſure of Manners. As to the former, they took an exact account of the Eſtates and Goods of every Perſon, and accordingly divided the People into their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Claſſes</hi> and <hi>Centuries.</hi> Beſides this, they took care of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Taxes, and made Laws in reference to them. They were Inſpectors of the Publick Buildings and Ways, and defray'd the Charges of ſuch Sacrifices as were made upon the Publick ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to the latter part of their Office, they had the power to puniſh an Immorality in any Perſon, of what Order ſoever.<note place="margin">Sonatu ejicere.</note> The <hi>Senators</hi> they might expel the Houſe, which was done by omitting ſuch a Perſon when they call'd over the Names.

And ſometimes when a <hi>Senator,</hi> or Knight, had been guilty of any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Irregularity, he ſuffer'd two of theſe Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, or all three at once.</p>

                  <p>The greateſt part of the <hi>Cenſor</hi>'s publick Buſineſs was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd in the <hi>Campus Martius</hi> every fifth Year; when, after the Survey of the People, and Inquiſition into their Manners, the <hi>Cenſors</hi> made a ſolemn <hi>Luſtration,</hi> or expiatory Sacrifice, in the name of all the People. The Sacrifice conſiſted of a Sow, a Sheep, and a Bull, whence it took the Name of <hi>Suovetaurilia.</hi> The Ceremony of performing it they call'd <hi>Luſtrum condere;</hi> and upon this account the ſpace of Five Years came to be ſignified by the word <hi>Luſtrum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis very remarkable, that if one of the <hi>Cenſor's</hi> died, no body was ſubſtituted in his room 'till the next <hi>Luſtrum,</hi> and his Partner was oblig'd to quit his Office; becauſe the Death of a <hi>Cenſor</hi> happen'd juſt before the ſacking of <hi>Rome</hi> by the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and was ever after accounted highly ominous and unfortunate<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Vide <hi>Liv.</hi> lib. 4, 5, 6, 9. <hi>Plut.</hi> Probl. 50.</note>.</p>

                  <p>Their Authority was extraordinary; for though at firſt they pretended only to be a ſort of Protectors of the Commons, and Redreſſers of Publick Grievances, yet afterwards they uſurp'd the Power of doing almoſt whatever they pleas'd, having the whole Populacy to back and ſecure them: And therefore they aſſembled the People, preferr'd Laws, made Decrees, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted them upon the Magiſtrates themſelves; and ſometimes commanded the very Conſuls to be carried to Priſon: And were, without queſtion, the Authors of far greater Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities between the Nobles and Commons, than they were at firſt created to appeaſe.</p>
                  <p>That which gain'd them the greateſt ſecurity, was their repute of being <hi>Sacroſancti,</hi> which they confirm'd by a Law: So that 'twas reckon'd the higheſt Act of Impiety to offer them the leaſt Injury, or ſo much as to interrupt them when they were ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

Upon the return of the Commiſſioners, the <hi>Tribunes</hi> claiming the Promiſe of the <hi>Senate</hi> to allow them a new Magiſtracy for the putting the Project in execution, it was agreed, That Ten Men out of the chief <hi>Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> ſhou'd be elected: That their Power ſhou'd be equal to that of the <hi>Kings,</hi> or <hi>Conſuls,</hi> for a whole Year: And, That in the mean time, all other Offices ſhou'd ceaſe. The <hi>Decemviri</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving now taken the Government upon them, agreed that only one of them ſhou'd at one time enjoy the <hi>Faſces</hi> and other <hi>Conſular</hi> Ornaments; ſhou'd aſſemble the <hi>Senate,</hi> confirm Decrees, and act in all reſpects as Supreme Magiſtrate. To this Honour they were to ſucceed by turns 'till the Year was out; and the reſt were oblig'd to differ very little in their Habits from private Perſons, to give the People the leſs ſuſpicion of Tyranny and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Government.</p>
                  <p>At length having made a Model out of ſuch Laws as had been brought from <hi>Greece,</hi> and the Cuſtoms of their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, they expos'd it to the publicl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The War being expir'd, a farther continuance of this Office was voted neceſſary, becauſe ſomething ſeem'd yet to be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the perfecting of the Deſign.

Two more Tables indeed they added to the Firſt, and ſo ſeem'd to have anſwer'd the Intent of their Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution: Yet they not only kept their Office the remaining part of that Year, but uſurp'd it again the next, without any regard to the Approbation of the <hi>Senate</hi> or People. And though there was ſome ſtir made in the City for putting a ſtop to their Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; yet they maintain'd their abſolute Power, 'till an Action of their chief Leader <hi>Appius</hi> gave a final Ruine to their Authority <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

The ſtiffeſt of the <hi>Patricians</hi> violently oppos'd this Requeſt, as a fair means to ruine their Honour and Authority, and to bring all Perſons, of whatever Quality, upon the ſame level.

                  <p>Both Parties readily embrac'd this Propoſal, and accordingly proceeded to an Election; where, though the whole deſign of this Stir, had been purely to encreaſe the Honour of the Commons, yet when the matter came to be put to the Vote, they choſe none of that Order to the new Magiſtracy, but conferr'd the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

Beſides this, they procur'd a Decree of <hi>Senate,</hi> to determine the extent of their Provinces, the number of their Forces, the Pay that ſhou'd be allow'd them, with all other Neceſſaries for their Journey and Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>By the paſſing of this Decree, they were ſaid <hi>Ornari Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciâ;</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> uſeth in the ſame ſence <hi>Ornari Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritoribus,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:66439:89"/>Scribis,</hi> &amp;c. who made a part of the <hi>Proconſul</hi>'s Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants.</p>
                  <p>Nothing now remain'd, but at the end of the Year to ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for their New Government. But we muſt obſerve, that tho' the <hi>Senate</hi> had given them leave to depart, yet the <hi>Tribunes</hi> of the Commons had power to ſtop their Journey; and therefore becauſe <hi>Craſſus</hi> went <hi>Proconſul</hi> into <hi>Parthia,</hi> contrary to the expreſs Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the <hi>Tribune;</hi> he was generally believ'd to have loſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, and his own Life, as a Judgment on him for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing the Authority of that Officer, whom they always counted <hi>Sacroſanctus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At their firſt entrance on their Province, they ſpent ſome time in conference with their immediate Predeceſſor, to be inform'd in the ſtate of Things, though their Adminiſtration began the very Day of their arrival.</p>
                  <p>Their Authority, both Civil and Military, was very extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary. The Winter they generally ſpent in the execution of the firſt, and the Summer in the diſcharge of the latter.</p>
                  <p>They decided Caſes of Equity and Juſtice, either privately in their <hi>Praetorium,</hi> or Palace; where they receiv'd Petitioners, heard Complaints, granted Writs under their Seal, and the like; or elſe publickly in the Common-Hall, with the uſual Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies and Formalities obſerv'd in Courts of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Proceſſes being in all reſpects the ſame as thoſe at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides this, by virtue of their Edicts, they had the Power of ordering all things relating to the Tributes, Taxes, Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Proviſions of Corn and Money, and whatever elſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to the Chief Adminiſtration of Affairs.</p>
                  <p>Their return from the Command was very remarkable: They either met their Succeſſor at his arrival, and immediately deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd into his hands the Charge of the Army, being oblig'd to leave the Province in Thirty Days; or elſe they came away before-hand, and left a Deputy in their room to perform the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of a Reſignation, having firſt made up their Accounts, and left them in writing in the two chief Cities of their ſeveral Provinces.</p>
                  <p>Upon their arrival at <hi>Rome,</hi> if they had no Thoughts of a Triumph, they preſently dimiſs'd their Train, and entred the City as private Perſons. If they aſpir'd to this Honour, they ſtill retain'd the <hi>Faſces,</hi> and other <hi>Proconſular</hi> Ornaments, and gave the <hi>Senate</hi> (aſſembled for this purpoſe in the Temple of <hi>Bellona</hi>) a relation of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:66439:89"/>Trimph. But in both Caſes they were oblig'd to give in their Accounts into the Publick Treaſury within Thirty Days.</p>
                  <p>Though the <hi>Proconſuls</hi> order'd Matters as they pleas'd during their Honour; yet at their return, a very ſtrict account was made into the whole courſe of their Government; and upon the diſcovery of any ill dealing, 'twas uſual to prefer Bills againſt them, and bring them to a formal Trial. The Crimes moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly objected againſt them were <hi>crimen peculatûs,</hi> relating to their ill uſe of the Publick Money, and the deficiency of their Accounts: <hi>Majeſtatis,</hi> of Treachery and Perfidiouſneſs againſt the Commonwealth; or <hi>Repetundarum,</hi> of Oppreſſion or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion exercis'd upon the Inhabitants of the Provinces, whom, as their Allies and Confederates, the <hi>Romans</hi> were oblig'd to Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize and defend.</p>

                  <p>IN the firſt times of the Common-wealth, the <hi>Provinces</hi> were govern'd by <hi>Praetors;</hi> and as the Dominions of the State were enlarg'd, the Number of thoſe Magiſtrates was accordingly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd;
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:66439:90"/>yet even in thoſe times, if they continu'd in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the <hi>Province,</hi> beyond the time prefix'd for the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of their <hi>Praetorſhip,</hi> they took upon them the Names of <hi>Propraetors,</hi> though they ſtill kept the ſame Authority as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>About <hi>A. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>. C.</hi> 604. the deſign'd <hi>Praetors</hi> began to divide the <hi>Praetorian,</hi> or leſſer <hi>Provinces,</hi> by Lot, in the ſame manner as the <hi>Conſuls</hi> did the <hi>Conſular;</hi> and when at the end of the Year they repair'd to their reſpective Governments, aſſum'd the Title of <hi>Propraetors.</hi> As their creation was the ſame as that of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſuls;</hi> ſo their entrance upon their Office, and the whole courſe of their Adminiſtration, was exactly anſwerable to theirs; only that they were allow'd but Six <hi>Lictors,</hi> with an equal Number of <hi>Faſces,</hi> whereas the <hi>Proconſuls</hi> had Twelve of each.</p>
                  <p>Now though before the time of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> the <hi>Propraetors,</hi> by reaſon of their preſiding over the <hi>Provinces</hi> of leſſer Note and Importance, were always reckon'd inferiour to the <hi>Proconſuls;</hi> yet upon his diviſion of the <hi>Provinces,</hi> the Governours of thoſe which fell to his ſhare bearing the Name of <hi>Propraetors,</hi> got the Preference of the <hi>Proconſuls,</hi> in reſpect of Power and Authority, being inveſted with the Military Command, and continuing in their Office as long as the Emperour pleas'd.</p>
                  <p>The chief Aſſiſtants of the <hi>Proconſuls,</hi> and the <hi>Propraetors,</hi> were the <hi>Legati</hi> and the Provincial <hi>Quaeſtors.</hi> The former, being dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in number, according to the Quality of the Governour whom they accompanied, ſerv'd for the judging of inferiour Cauſes, and the management of all ſmaller Concerns, remitting every thing of moment to the Care of the Governour, or Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the <hi>Legati,</hi> there went with every <hi>Proconſul,</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praetor,</hi> one or more <hi>Quaeſtors,</hi> whoſe whole Buſineſs was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in managing the Publick Accounts, taking care of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of Money, Corn, and other Neceſſaries and Conveniences for the maintenance of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army.</p>
                  <p>We ſeldom meet with <hi>Proquaeſtors</hi> in Authors, they being only ſuch as perform'd the Office of <hi>Quaeſtor</hi> in the <hi>Provinces,</hi> without the deputation of the <hi>Senate,</hi> which was requiſite to the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the proper <hi>Quaeſtors.</hi> This happen'd either when a <hi>Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor</hi> died in his Office, or went to <hi>Rome</hi> without being ſucceeded by another <hi>Quaeſtor:</hi> For in both theſe caſes, the Governour of the Province appointed another in his room, to diſcharge the ſame Duties under the Name of <hi>Proquaeſtor.</hi>

                  <p>Of the like nature with theſe <hi>Quaeſtors</hi> were the <hi>Procuratores Caeſaris,</hi> often mention'd by <hi>Tacitus</hi> and <hi>Suetonius;</hi> Officers ſent by the Emperours into every Province, to receive and regulate the Publick Revenue, and to diſpoſe of it at the Emperour's Command.</p>
                  <p>Such a Magiſtrate was <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> in <hi>Judaea;</hi> and though the judging of extream Cauſes did not properly belong to his Office; yet becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> were always look'd upon as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Nation, and apt to revolt upon the leaſt occaſion; and becauſe the Preſident of <hi>Syria</hi> was forced to attend on other parts of his Province; therefore for the better keeping the <hi>Jews</hi> in order, the <hi>Procurator</hi> of <hi>Judaea</hi> was inveſted with all the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity proper to the Proconſul, even with the Power of Life and Death, as the Learned Biſhop <hi>Pearſon</hi> obſerves<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Biſhop <hi>Pearſon</hi> on the Creed. <hi>Art. 4.</hi>

                  <p>The proper <hi>Comitia</hi> were of three ſorts; <hi>Curiata, Genturiata,</hi> and <hi>Tributa;</hi> with reference to the Three grand Diviſions of the City and People into <hi>Curiae, Centuries,</hi> and <hi>Tribes:</hi> For by <hi>Comitia Calata,</hi> which we ſometimes meet with in Authors, in elder times were meant all the <hi>Comitia</hi> in general, the Word <hi>Calata,</hi> from <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>The <hi>Comitia Curiata</hi> owe their Original to the Diviſion which <hi>Romulus</hi> made of the People into Thirty <hi>Curiae,</hi> Ten being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd under every <hi>Tribe.</hi> They anſwer'd, in moſt reſpects, to the Pariſhes in our Cities, being not only ſeparated by proper

                  <p>Before the Inſtitution of the <hi>Comitia Centuriata,</hi> all the grand Concerns of the State were tranſacted in the Aſſembly of the <hi>Curia's;</hi> as, the Election of Kings, and other Chief Officers, the making and abrogating of Laws, and the adjudging of capital Cauſes. After the expulſion of the Kings, when the Commons had obtain'd the Privilege to have <hi>Tribunes</hi> and <hi>Aediles,</hi> they ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted them for ſome time at theſe Aſſemblies: But that Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny being at length transferr'd to the <hi>Comitia Tributa,</hi> the <hi>Curiae</hi> were never conven'd to give their Votes, except now and then upon account of making ſome particular Laws, relating to Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions, Wills, and Teſtaments, or the Creation of Officers for an Expedition; or for the Electing of ſome of the Prieſts, as the <hi>Flamines,</hi> and the <hi>Curio maximus,</hi> or Superintendant of the <hi>Curiones,</hi> who themſelves were choſe by every particular <hi>Curia.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Prerogative-Century</hi> being choſe by lot, the Chief Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate ſitting in a<note n="*" place="margin">Tabernaculum.</note> Tent in the middle of the <hi>Campus Martius,</hi> order'd that <hi>Century</hi> to come out and give their Voices; upon which, they preſently ſeparated from the reſt of the Multitude, and came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an inclos'd Apartment, which they term'd <hi>Septa,</hi> or <hi>Ovilia,</hi> paſſing over the <hi>Pontes,</hi> or narrow Boards, laid there for the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; on which account <hi>de Ponte dejici</hi> is to be deny'd the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of Voting.</p>
                  <p>At the hither end of the <hi>Pontes</hi> ſtood the <hi>Diribitores</hi> (a ſort of under-Officers, call'd ſo from dividing or martialling the People) and deliver'd to every Man, in the election of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, as many Tablets as there appear'd Candidates,<note place="margin">Tabellae.</note> one of whoſe Names was wrote upon every Tablet.</p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:66439:92"/>
                  <p>A fit number of great Cheſts were ſet ready in the <hi>Septa,</hi> and every body threw in which Tablet he pleas'd.</p>
                  <p>By the Cheſts were plac'd ſome of the publick Servants, who taking out the Tablets of every <hi>Century,</hi> for every Tablet made a Prick, or a Point, in another Table which they kept by them. Thus the Buſineſs being decided by moſt Points, gave occaſion to the Phraſe of <hi>Omne tulit punctum (a),</hi> and the like.</p>
                  <p>The ſame method was obſerv'd in the judiciary Proceſſes at theſe <hi>Comitia,</hi> and in the Confirmation of Laws; except that in both theſe caſes only two Tablets were offer'd to every Perſon, on one of which was wrote <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>.

                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis remarkable, that though in the Election of Magiſtrates, and in the Ratification of Laws, the Votes of that <hi>Century</hi> whoſe Tablets were equally divided, ſignify'd nothing; yet in Trials of Life and Death, if the Tablets <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> were the ſame in number, the Perſon was actually acquitted<note n="(l)" place="bottom">

                  <p>The diviſion of the People into <hi>Tribes,</hi> was an invention of <hi>Romulus,</hi> after he had admitted the <hi>Sabines</hi> into <hi>Rome;</hi> and though he conſtituted at that time only Three, yet as the State encreas'd in Power, and the City in number of Inhabitants, they roſe by degrees to Five and Thirty. The diſtinction of <hi>Tribus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbanae,</hi> and <hi>Ruſticae,</hi> was at firſt taken up for a difference between thoſe People who inhabited the City, and thoſe who dwelt in other parts: But at laſt the <hi>Country-Tribes</hi> being eſteem'd the moſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, engroſs'd the whole number except Four.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The whole ſubject of the <hi>Roman</hi> Judgments is admirably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd by <hi>Sigonius,</hi> in his Three Books <hi>de Judiciis,</hi> from whom the following Account is for the moſt part extracted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Judgments,</hi> or <hi>Determinations</hi> of a proper <hi>Judge,</hi> were made either by a competent number of ſelect Judges, or by the whole People in a General Aſſembly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Judgments</hi> made by one or more ſelect <hi>Judges,</hi> may be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into publick and private; the firſt relating to Controverſies, the ſecond to Crimes.</p>
                  <p>The former will be ſufficiently deſcrib'd, if we conſider the Matter, or Subject, of theſe <hi>Judgments,</hi> the Perſons concern'd in them, and the manner of proceeding.</p>
                  <p>The matter of private <hi>Judgments</hi> takes in all ſort of Cauſes that can happen between Man and Man; which being ſo vaſtly extended, and belonging more immediately to the <hi>Civil</hi> Law, need not here be inſiſted on.</p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:66439:93"/>
                  <p>The Perſons concern'd were the Parties, the Aſſiſtants, and the Judges.</p>
                  <p>The Parties were the <hi>Actor</hi> and <hi>Reus,</hi> the Plaintiff and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant.</p>
                  <p>The Aſſiſtants were the <hi>Procurâtores,</hi> and the <hi>Advocati,</hi> of whom, tho' they are often confounded, yet the firſt were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſuch Lawyers as aſſiſted the Plaintiff in proving, or the Defendant in clearing himſelf from the matter of Fact: The other, who were likewiſe call'd <hi>Patroni,</hi> were to defend their Clients Cauſe in matters of Law<note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Zouch, Element. Juriſprud.</hi> p. 5. Sect. 3.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Both theſe were ſelected out of the ableſt Lawyers, and had their Names entred in the Matriculation-Book of the <hi>Forum.</hi> This was one Condition requiſite to give them the liberty of Pleading; the other was the being retain'd by one Party, or the receiving a Fee, which they term'd <hi>Mandatum</hi>
                     <note n="(b)" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The Judges, beſides the <hi>Praetor,</hi> or ſupreme Magiſtrate, who preſided in the Court, and allow'd and confirm'd them, were of three ſorts. <hi>Arbitri, Recuperatores,</hi> and <hi>Centumviri litibus ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicandis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arbitri,</hi> whom they call'd ſimply <hi>judices,</hi> were appointed to determine in ſome private Cauſes of no great Conſequence, and of very eaſie deciſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Recuperatores</hi> were aſſign'd to decide the Controverſies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout receiving or recovering things which had been loſt or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away.</p>
                  <p>But the uſual Judges in private Cauſes, were the <hi>Centumviri;</hi> three of which were taken out of every Tribe, ſo that their number was five more than their Name imported. 'Tis proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the <hi>Arbitri</hi> and <hi>Recuperatores</hi> were aſſign'd out of this Body by the <hi>Praetor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The manner of carrying on the private Suits was of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The difference failing to be made up between Friends, the injur'd Perſon proceeded <hi>in jus reum vocare,</hi> to ſummon or cite the offending Party to the Court; who was oblig'd imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to go with him, or elſe to give Bond for his appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; according to the common Maxim, <hi>In jus vocatus aut eat aut ſatiſdet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Both Parties being met before the <hi>Praetor,</hi> or other ſupreme Magiſtrate preſiding in the Court, the Plaintiff propos'd the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Defendant, in which he deſign'd to ſue him: This they term'd <hi>Edere actionem,</hi> being perform'd commonly by
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:66439:94"/>writing it in a Tablet, and offering it to the Defendant, that he might ſee whether he had beſt compound or ſtand the Suit.</p>
                  <p>In the next place came the <hi>poſtulatio actionis,</hi> or the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff's deſiring leave of the <hi>Praetor</hi> to proſecute the Defendant in ſuch an Action: This being granted, the Plaintiff, <hi>vadabatur re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> oblig'd him to give Sureties for his appearance on ſuch a Day in the Court; and this was all that was done in publick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the prefix'd Day for the Tryal.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the difference us'd very often to be made up, either <hi>Tranſactionc,</hi> or <hi>Pacto,</hi> by letting the Cauſe fall as dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and uncertain; or by compoſition for ſo much damage, to be aſcertain'd by an equal number of Friends.</p>
                  <p>On the Day appointed for the hearing, the <hi>Praetor</hi> order'd the ſeveral Bills to be read, and the Parties to be ſummon'd by an <hi>Accenſus</hi> or Beadle. Upon the default of either Party, the Defaulter loſt his Cauſe. The appearing of both they term'd <hi>ſe ſtitiſſe;</hi> and then the Plaintiff proceeded <hi>litem ſive actionem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendere,</hi> to prefer the Suit; which was perform'd in a ſet Form of Words, varying according to the difference of the Actions. After this the Plaintiff deſir'd Judgment of the <hi>Praetor;</hi> that is, to be allow'd a <hi>Judex</hi> or <hi>Arbiter,</hi> or elſe the <hi>Recuperatores</hi> or <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumviri,</hi> for the hearing and deciding the buſineſs; but none of theſe could be deſir'd, unleſs both Parties agreed. The <hi>Praetor,</hi> when he aſſign'd them their Judges, at the ſame time defin'd the number of Witneſſes, to hinder the protracting of the Suit; and then the Parties proceeded to give caution, that the Judgment, whatever it was, ſhould ſtand and be perform'd on both ſides. The Judges always took a ſolemn Oath to be impartial; and the Parties ſwore they did not go to Law with a deſign to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe one another: This they call'd <hi>Juramentum calumniae.</hi> Then began the <hi>Diſceptatio cauſae,</hi> or diſputing the Caſe, manag'd by the Lawyers on both ſides, with the aſſiſtance of Witneſſes, Writings, and the like; the uſe of which is ſo admirably taught in their Books of Oratory.</p>
                  <p>In giving Sentence, the major part of the Judges was requir'd to overthrow the Defendant.

                  <p>The conſequence of the Sentence was either <hi>in integrum reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutio, addictio, judicium calumniae,</hi> or <hi>judicium falſi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt was, when upon Petition of the Party who was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown, the <hi>Praetor</hi> gave him leave to have the Suit come on again, and allow him another full hearing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Addictio</hi> was, when the Party who had been caſt in ſuch a Sum, unleſs he gave Surety to pay it in a little time, was brought by the Plaintiff before the <hi>Praetor,</hi> who deliver'd him into his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, to be committed to Priſon, or otherwiſe ſecur'd, 'till ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction were made.</p>

                  <p>FOR the knowledge of Publick Judgments, we may take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Crimes, of the Puniſhments, of the <hi>Quaeſitors</hi> and Judges, of the method of proceeding, and of the conſequences of the Tryal.</p>
                  <p>The Crimes, or the matter of the Publick Judgments, were ſuch Actions as tended either mediately or immediately, to the prejudice of the State, and were forbid by the Laws. As if any Perſon had derogated from the Honour and Majeſty of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth; had imbezzel'd or put to ill uſes the publick Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or any Treaſure conſecrated to Religion; or had corrupted the Peoples Votes in an Election; or had extorted Contributions from the Allies; or received Money in any Judgment; or had us'd any violent Compulſion to a Member of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: Theſe they term'd <hi>Crimina Majeſtatis, peculatûs, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tûs, repetundarum,</hi> and <hi>vis publicae:</hi> Or if any Perſon had kill'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother with a Weapon, or effected the ſame with Poyſon; or laid violent Hands on his Parents; or had forg'd a Will; or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited the publick Coin; or had corrupted another Man's Wife; or had bought, bound, or conceal'd a Servant without the knowledge of his Maſter: Whence theſe Crimes took the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:66439:95"/>Names, <hi>inter ſicarios, veneficii, parricidii, falſi, adulterii, plagii.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe, any private Cauſe, by virtue of a new Law, might be made of publick Cognizance.</p>
                  <p>As to the Puniſhments, they may be allow'd a Chapter by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves hereafter.</p>
                  <p>The Inquiſition of Criminal Matters belong'd at firſt to the Kings, and, after the abrogation of that Government, for ſome time to the Conſuls: But being taken from them by the <hi>Valerian Law,</hi> it was conferr'd, as Occaſions happen'd, upon Officers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted by the People, with the Title of <hi>Quaeſitores Parricidii.</hi> But about the Year of the City 604. this power was made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual, and appropriated to the <hi>Praetors,</hi> by virtue of an Order of the People at their annual Election; the Inquiſition of ſuch and ſuch Crimes being committed to ſuch and ſuch <hi>Praetors:</hi> Yet upon extraordinary Occaſions the People could appoint o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Quaeſitores,</hi> if they thought convenient.</p>
                  <p>Next to the <hi>Quaeſitor,</hi> was the <hi>Judex quaeſtionis;</hi> who, tho' he is ſometimes confounded with the <hi>Praetor,</hi> yet was properly a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Note, deputed by the <hi>Praetor</hi> to manage the Tryal, of which he himſelf perform'd only the main buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>After him were the <hi>Judices ſelecti,</hi> who were ſummon'd by the <hi>Praetor</hi> to give their Verdict in Criminal Matters, in the ſame manner as our Juries. They were choſe every Year to a ſet number deſin'd by the Laws, which by reaſon of the preferring of new Laws, often varied.</p>
                  <p>As to the method of the Proceedings, the firſt Action, which they term'd <hi>in jus vocatio,</hi> was much the ſame in publick as in private Cauſes: But then, as the <hi>Poſtulatio</hi> of the Plaintiff con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in deſiring leave of the <hi>Praetor</hi> to enter a Suit againſt the Deſendant; ſo here the Accuſer deſir'd permiſſion to enter the Name of the Offender, with the Crime which he objected to him: This they call'd <hi>Nomiras delatio;</hi> being perform'd firſt <hi>vivâ</hi> in a ſet Form of Words, according to the nature of the Crime, and then offer'd to the <hi>Praetor,</hi> being wrot in a Tablet; if approv'd by the <hi>Praetor,</hi> the accus'd Party's Name was entred in the Roll of Criminals; both Perſons having taken the <hi>Oath of Calum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>At the entrance of the Name, the <hi>Praetor</hi> appointed a ſet Day for the Tryal: And from that time the accus'd Perſon chang'd his Habit, going in Black 'till the Tryal was over, and uſing in his Dreſs and Carriage all Tokens of Sorrow and Concern.</p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:66439:95"/>
                  <p>Upon the appointed Day, the Court being met, and both Parties appearing, the firſt thing that was done, was the <hi>ſortitio ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicum,</hi> or impannelling the Jury; perform'd commonly by the <hi>Judex Quaeſtionis,</hi> who took by Lot ſuch a number out of the Body of the <hi>Judices ſelecti,</hi> as the particular Law on which the Accuſation was founded, had determin'd; Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty being given to both Parties to reject (or, as we call it, to challenge) any that they pleas'd, the <hi>Praetor</hi> or <hi>Judex Quaeſtionis</hi> ſubſtituting others in their Places.</p>
                  <p>The Jury being thus choſe was cited by the publick Servants of the Court; and when the proper number appear'd, they were ſworn, and then took their places in the <hi>Subſellia,</hi> and heard the Tryal.</p>

                     <hi>Defenſio</hi> belong'd to the Lawyers or Advocates retain'd by the accus'd Party, who in like manner were allow'd to ſpeak as many Days as they pleas'd, toward the clearing of their Client. The three common Methods they took, were <hi>Facti negatio, negatio nominis facti,</hi> or <hi>probatio jure factum:</hi> either plainly to deny the matter of Fact, and endeavour to evince the contrary; or elſe to acknowledge the Fact, and yet to deny that it fell under the nature of the Crime objected: Or, laſtly, to prove the Fact lawful.</p>
                  <p>The firſt way of Defence was generally us'd when the Perſon ſtood indicted of what they call'd <hi>crimen repetundarum,</hi> and <hi>cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ambitûs;</hi> the next in the <hi>crimen Majeſtatis,</hi> and the laſt in caſes of Murder.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cicero</hi> has given us an excellent Example in every kind. Of the firſt in his Orations for <hi>Fonteius, Flaccus, Muraena,</hi> and <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius:</hi>
                     <pb n="136" facs="tcp:66439:96"/>Of the ſecond in that for <hi>Cornelius;</hi> and of the third in his admirable defence of <hi>Milo.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Laudatio</hi> was a cuſtom like that in our Tryals, of bringing in Perſons of credit to give their Teſtimony of the accus'd Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's good Behaviour, and integrity of Life. The leaſt number of theſe <hi>Laudatores</hi> us'd to be Ten.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>latio ſententiae,</hi> or pronouncing Sentence, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded thus: After the Orators on both ſides had ſaid all they deſign'd, the Cryer gave notice of it accordingly; and then the <hi>Praetor</hi> ſent out the Jury to conſult, <hi>(mittebat judices in conſilium)</hi> delivering to every one Three Tablets cover'd with Wax, one of Abſolution, another of Condemnation, and a third of <hi>Ampliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> or Adjournment of the Tryal; the firſt being mark'd with A; the ſecond with C; the other with N, L. or <hi>non li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the place where the Jury withdrew was ſet a proper num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Urns, or Boxes, into which they threw what Tablet they pleas'd; the accus'd Perſon proſtrating himſelf all this while at their Feet, to move their Compaſſion.</p>
                  <p>The Tablets being drawn, and the greateſt number known, the <hi>Praetor</hi> pronounc'd Sentence accordingly. The Form of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation was uſually <hi>videntur feciſſe,</hi> or <hi>non jure videtur feciſſe:</hi> Of Abſolution, <hi>non videtur feciſſe:</hi> Of <hi>Ampliation, amplius cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſcendum.</hi> Sometimes he mention'd the Puniſhment, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times left it out, as being determin'd by the Law, on which the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment was grounded.</p>
                  <p>The conſequences of the Tryal in criminal Matters may be reduc'd to theſe four Heads, <hi>Aeſtimatio litis, Animadverſio, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicium calumniae,</hi> and <hi>Judicium praevaricationis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aeſtimatio litis;</hi> or the rating of the Damages, was in uſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Caſes of Bribery, and abuſe of the publick Money.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Animadverſio,</hi> was no more than the putting the Sentence in execution, which was left to the care of the <hi>Praetor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in caſe the Party was abſolv'd, there lay two Actions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Accuſer; one of Calumny, the common Puniſhment of which was <hi>frontis inuſtio,</hi> burning in the Forehead: And the other of Prevarication, when the Accuſer, inſtead of urging the Crime home, ſeem'd rather to hide or extenuate the Guilt: Hence the Civilians define a Prevaricator, to be <hi>one that betrays his Cauſe to the Adverſary, and turns on the Criminal's ſide wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>CHAP. XIX.</hi> Judgments of the whole People.</head>
                  <p>THE People were ſometimes the Judges both in private and publick Cauſes; tho' of the firſt we have only one Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in <hi>Livy</hi>
                     <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Lib. 3.</note>; the other we frequently meet with in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Judgments were made firſt at the <hi>Comitia Curiata,</hi> and afterwards at the <hi>Centuriata,</hi> and <hi>Tributa;</hi> the Proceedings in all which Aſſemblies have been already ſhewn: What we may further obſerve is this: When any Magiſtrate deſign'd to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach a Perſon of a Crime before the whole People, he aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Roſtra,</hi> and calling the People together by a Cryer, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to them, That upon ſuch a Day he intended to accuſe ſuch a Perſon of ſuch a Crime: This they term'd <hi>reo diem dicere:</hi> The ſuſpected Party was oblig'd immediately to give Sureties for his Appearance on the Day prefix'd, and in default of Bail was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to Priſon.</p>
                  <p>On the appointed Day the Magiſtrate again aſcended the <hi>Roſtra,</hi> and cited the Party by the Cryer; who, unleſs ſome other Magiſtrate of equal Authority interpos'd, or a ſufficient Excuſe was offer'd, was oblig'd to appear, or might be puniſh'd at the Pleaſure of the Magiſtrate who accus'd him. If he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd, the Accuſer began his Charge, and carried it on every other Day for ſix Days together; at the end of the Indictment, mentioning the particular Puniſhment ſpecified in the Law for ſuch an Offence: This intimation they term'd <hi>anquiſitio.</hi> The ſame was immediately after expreſs'd in Writing, and then took the Name of <hi>Rogatio,</hi> in reſpect of the People who were to be ask'd or conſulted about it; and <hi>Irrogatio</hi> in reſpect of the Criminal, as it imported the Mulct or Puniſhment aſſign'd him by the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer. This <hi>Rogatio</hi> was publickly expos'd three <hi>Nundinae,</hi> or Market-days together, for the information of the People. On the third Market-day the Accuſer again aſcended the <hi>Roſtra;</hi> and,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:66439:97"/>the People being call'd together, undertook the fourth turn of his Charge, and having concluded, gave the other Party leave to enter upon his Defence, either in his own Perſon, or by his Advocates.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time as the Accuſer finiſh'd his fourth Charge, he gave notice what Day he'd have the <hi>Comitia</hi> meet to receive the Bill, the <hi>Comitia Tributa</hi> to conſider of Mulcts, and the <hi>Centuriata</hi> for Capital Puniſhments.</p>
                  <p>But in the mean time there were ſeveral ways by which the accus'd Party might be reliev'd,; as firſt, if the Tribunes of the Commons interpos'd in his behalf; or if he excus'd himſelf by voluntary Exile, Sickneſs, or upon account of providing for a Funeral; or if he prevail'd with the Accuſer to relinquiſh his Charge, and let the Cauſe fall; or if upon the Day appointed for the <hi>Comitia,</hi> the <hi>Augurs</hi> diſcover'd any ill Omens; and ſo forbad the Aſſembly.</p>
                  <p>If none of theſe happen'd, the <hi>Comitia</hi> met, and proceeded, as has been already deſcrib'd; and as for the <hi>Animadverſio,</hi> or putting the Sentence in execution, this was perform'd in the ſame manner as in the <hi>Praetorian</hi> Judgments.</p>
                  <p>The Forms of Judgments which have been thus deſcrib'd, muſt be ſuppos'd to have prevail'd chiefly in the time of the free State: For as the Kings before, ſo the Emperours after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards were themſelves Judges in what Cauſes, and after what manner they pleas'd; as <hi>Suetonius</hi> particularly informs us of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the Twelve <hi>Caeſars.</hi> 'Twas this gave occaſion to the riſe of the <hi>Mandatores</hi> and <hi>Delatores,</hi> a ſort of Wretches to be met with in every part of Hiſtory. The buſineſs of the former was to mark down ſuch Perſons as upon Inquiſition they pretended to have found guilty of any Miſdemeanour; and the latter were employ'd in accuſing and proſecuting them upon the other's Order. This miſchievous Tribe, as they were counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanc'd and rewarded by ill Princes, ſo were they extremely deteſted by the good Emperours. <hi>Titus</hi> proſecuted all that could be found upon the moſt diligent ſearch, with Death or perpetual Baniſhment<note n="(b)" place="bottom">

                  <p>THE accurate <hi>Sigonius</hi> has divided the Puniſhments into eight ſorts, <hi>Damnum, Vincula, Verbera, Talio, Ignominia, Exilium, Servitus, Mors.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Damnum</hi> was a pecuniary Mulct or Fine ſet upon the Offender, according to the quality of the Crime.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vincula</hi> ſignifies the guilty Perſon's being condemn'd to Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment and Fetters; of which they had many ſorts, as <hi>Manicae, Pedicae, Nervi, Boiae,</hi> and the like.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Verbera,</hi> or Stripes, were inflicted either with Rods <hi>[Virgae]</hi> or with Battoons <hi>[Fuſtes:]</hi> The firſt commonly preceded capital Puniſhments, properly ſo call'd: The other was moſt in uſe in the Camp, and belong'd to the Military Diſcipline.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Talio</hi> was a Puniſhment by which the guilty Perſon ſuffer'd exactly after the ſame manner as he had offended; as in Caſes of maiming, and the like. Yet <hi>Agellius</hi> informs us, that the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal was allow'd the liberty of compounding with the Perſon he had injur'd; ſo that he needed not ſuffer the <hi>Talio</hi> unleſs he voluntarily choſe it<note n="(e)" place="bottom">Vide <hi>Agell.</hi> lib. 11. cap. 1.</note>.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ignominia</hi> was no more than a publick Shame which the offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Perſon underwent, either by virtue of the <hi>Praetor</hi>'s Edict, or more commonly by Order of the <hi>Cenſor:</hi> This Puniſhment, beſides the Scandal, took away from the Party on whom 'twas inflicted
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:66439:98"/>the Privilege of bearing any Office, and almoſt all other Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a <hi>Roman</hi> Citizen.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Exilium</hi> was not a Puniſhment immediately, but by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; for the Phraſe us'd in the Sentence and Laws was <hi>Aquae &amp; ignis interdictio,</hi> the forbidding the uſe of Water and Fire, which being neceſſary for Life, the condemn'd Perſon was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to leave his Country. Yet in the times of the later Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, we find it to have been a poſitive Puniſhment, as appears from the Civil Law. <hi>Relegatio</hi> may be reckon'd under this Head, tho' it were ſomething different from the former; this being the ſending a Criminal to ſuch a Place, or for ſuch a Time, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps for ever, by which the Party was not depriv'd of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of a Citizen of <hi>Rome,</hi> as he was in the firſt ſort of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, which they properly call'd <hi>Exilium.

                  <p>The fifth Puniſhment, namely Crucifixion, was ſeldom infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted on any but Slaves, or the meaneſt of the Commons; yet we find ſome Examples of a different Practice; and <hi>Suetonius</hi> particularly relates of the Emperour <hi>Galba,</hi> that having condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a <hi>Roman</hi> Citizen to ſuffer this Puniſhment for poyſoning his Ward, the Gentleman, as he was carrying to Execution, made a grievous complaint, that a Citizen of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould undergo ſuch a ſervile Death; alledging the Laws to the contrary: The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour hearing his Plea, promis'd to alleviate the ſhame of his Sentence, and order'd a Croſs much larger and more neat than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary to be erected, and to be waſh'd over with White Paint, that the Gentleman who ſtood ſo much on his Quality might have the Honour to be hang'd in State<note n="(k)" place="bottom">

The <hi>Furca</hi> is divided by <hi>Lipſius</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Ignominioſa</hi> and <hi>Poenalis.</hi> The former <hi>Plutarch</hi> deſcribes to be that piece of Wood which ſupports the Thill of a Waggon: He adds, that 'twas one of the greateſt Penances for a Servant who had offended, to take this upon his Shoulders, and carry it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Neighbourhood; for whoever was ſeen with this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Burden, had no longer any Credit or Truſt among thoſe who knew it, but was call'd <hi>Furciſer</hi> by way of Ignominy and Reproach<note n="(l)" place="bottom">Vide <hi>Plutarch.</hi> in <hi>Coriolane.</hi>
                     </note>. <hi>Furca poenalis</hi> was a piece of Wood, much of the ſame ſhape as the former, which was faſtned about the convicted Perſon's Neck, he being generally either ſcourg'd to death un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it; or lifted up by it upon the Croſs. <hi>Lipſius</hi> makes it the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:66439:99"/>ſame with the <hi>Patibulum,</hi> and fanſies that for all the Name, it might not be a forked piece of Timber, but rather a ſtraight Beam, to which the Criminal's Arms being ſtretch'd out, were tied; and which, being holſted up at the place of Execution, ſerv'd for the tranſverſe part of the Croſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Projectio in profluentem</hi> was a Puniſhment proper to the Crime of Parricide; (or the Murder of any near Relation.) The Perſon convicted of this unnatural Guilt was immediately hooded, as unworthy of the common Light: In the next place he was whipp'd with Rods, and then ſow'd up in a Sack and thrown into the Sea; or, in Inland Countries, into the next Lake or River. Afterwards, for an Addition to the Puniſhment, a Serpent us'd to be put into the Sack with the Criminal; and by degrees, in later times, an Ape, a Dog, and a Cock. The Sack which held the Malefactor, was term'd <hi>Culeus;</hi> and hence the Puniſhment it ſelf is often ſignified by the ſame Name. The reaſon of the addition of the living Creatures is thought to have been, that the condemn'd Perſons might be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with ſuch troubleſome Company, and that their Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſes might want both burial and reſt. <hi>Juvenal</hi> expreſly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes to this Cuſtom in his eighth Satyr.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XXI.</hi> Of the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws in general.</head>
                  <p>IN the beginning of the <hi>Roman</hi> State, we are aſſur'd all things were manag'd by the ſole Authority of the King, without any certain Standard of Juſtice and Equity. But when the City grew tolerably populous, and was divided by <hi>Romulus</hi> into Thirty <hi>Curiae,</hi> he began to preferr Laws at the Aſſembly of thoſe <hi>Curiae,</hi> which were confirm'd, and univerſally receiv'd. The like pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice was follow'd by <hi>Numa,</hi> and ſeveral other Kings; all whoſe Conſtitutions being collected into one Body, by <hi>Sextus Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> who liv'd in the time of <hi>Tarquin the Proud,</hi> took from him the Name of <hi>Jus Papirianum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But all theſe were abrogated ſoon after the expulſion of the Royal Family, and the judicial Proceedings for many Years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, depended only on Cuſtom, and the Judgment of the Court. At laſt, to redreſs this Inconvenience, Commiſſioners were ſent into <hi>Greece,</hi> to make a Collection of the beſt Laws for the Service of their Country; and, at their return, the <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viri</hi> were created to regulate the Buſineſs, who reduc'd them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Twelve Tables, as has been already ſhewn. The excellency of which Inſtitution, as it is ſufficiently ſet forth by moſt Authors, ſo is it eſpecially beholden to the high <hi>Encomium</hi> of <hi>Cicero,</hi> when he declares it as his poſitive Judgment and Opinion, That <hi>the Laws of the Twelve Tables are juſtly to be preferr'd to whole Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Philoſophers</hi>
                     <note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Cicero</hi> de Oratore, lib. 1.</note>.</p>
                  <p>They were divided into three Parts, of which the firſt related to the Concerns of Religion; the ſecond to the Right of the Publick; and the laſt to private Perſons.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Laws being eſtabliſh'd, it neceſſarily follow'd, that there ſhou'd be Diſputations and Controverſies in the Courts, ſince the Interpretation was to be founded on the Authority of the Learned. This Interpretation they call'd <hi>Jus Civile,</hi> though at preſent we underſtand by that Phraſe the whole Syſtem of the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws.</p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:66439:100"/>
                  <p>Beſides, out of all theſe Laws, the Learned Men of that Time compos'd a Scheme of Forms and Caſes, by which the Proceſſes in the Courts were directed. Theſe were term'd <hi>Actiones Legis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We may add to theſe the Laws preferr'd at the Publick Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of the People; and the <hi>Plebiſcita,</hi> made without the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Senate, at the <hi>Comitia Tributa,</hi> which were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to be of equal force with other Conſtitutions, though they were not honour'd with the Title of <hi>Leges.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then the <hi>Senatus-conſulta,</hi> and Edicts of the Supreme Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, particularly of the <hi>Praeters,</hi> made up two more ſorts of Laws, the laſt of which they call'd <hi>Jus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                  </p>
                  <p>And, laſtly, when the Government was entruſted in the hands of a ſingle Perſon, whatever he ordain'd had the Authority of a Law, with the Name of <hi>Principalis Conſtitutio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moſt of theſe daily encreaſing, gave ſo much ſcope to the Lawyers for the compiling of Reports and other Labours, that in the Reign of <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> there were extant Two thouſand diſtinct Volumes on this Subject. The Body of the Law being thus grown unweildy, and render'd almoſt uſeleſs by its exceſſive Bulk, that excellent Emperour entred on a deſign to bring it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to juſt dimenſions; which was happily accompliſh'd in the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting thoſe Four Tomes of the <hi>Civil</hi> Law which are now extant, and have contributed in a great meaſure, to the regulating of all the States in Chriſtendom: So that the old Fancy of the <hi>Romans,</hi> about the eternity of their Command, is not ſo ridiculous as at firſt ſight it appears, ſince by their admirable Sanctions, they are ſtill like to Govern for ever.</p>

                  <p>There were many legal Excuſes which might keep Perſons from the Liſt; as, in caſe they were Fifty Years old, for then they cou'd not be oblig'd to ſerve; or if they enjoy'd any civil or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Office, which they cou'd not conveniently relinquiſh; or if they had already made Twenty Campagnes, which was the time requir'd for every Foot-ſoldier; or if upon account of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Merit, they had been by Publick Authority re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leas'd from the trouble of ſerving for ſuch a time; or if they were maim'd in any Part, and ſo ought not to be admitted into the Legions; as <hi>Suetonius</hi> tells us of a Father, who cut off the Thumbs of his two Sons, on purpoſe to keep them out of the Army<note n="(b)" place="bottom">

                  <p>As to the raiſing the Confederate Troops, <hi>Polybius</hi> informs us, That at the ſame time as the Levies were made in <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Conſuls</hi> gave notice to the Cities of the Allies in <hi>Italy,</hi> intimating the number of Forces they ſhou'd have occaſion to borrow of them, together with the Time and Place when and where they wou'd have them make their Rendezvous.

                  <p>THE whole <hi>Roman</hi> Infantry was divided into Four ſorts, <hi>Velites, Haſtati, Principes,</hi> and <hi>Triarii.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Velites</hi> were commonly ſome of the <hi>Tyro's,</hi> or young Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, of mean Condition, and lightly Arm'd. They had their Name <hi>à volando,</hi> or <hi>à velocitate,</hi> from their Swiftneſs and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. They ſeem not to have been divided into any diſtinct Bodies, or Companies, but to have hover'd in looſe Order before the Army.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Haſtati</hi> were ſo call'd, becauſe they us'd in ancient times to fight with Spears, which were afterwards laid aſide as incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious: Theſe were taken out of the next in Age to the <hi>Velites.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Principes</hi> were generally Men of middle Age, and of greateſt Vigour: 'Tis probable, that before the Inſtitution of the <hi>Haſtati,</hi> they us'd to begin the Fight, whence they borrow'd their Name.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Triarii</hi> were commonly <hi>Veterans,</hi> or hardy old Soldiers, of long Experience, and approv'd Valour. They had their Name from their Poſition, being Marſhal'd in the Third Place, as the main Strength and Hopes of their Party. They are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times call'd <hi>Pilarii,</hi> from their Weapons the <hi>Pila.</hi>

                  <p>Three <hi>Manipuli,</hi> One of the <hi>Haſtati,</hi> another of the <hi>Principes,</hi> and a Third of the <hi>Triarii,</hi> compos'd a Cohort. Among theſe, one was fill'd with ſome of the choiſeſt Soldiers and Officers, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Honourable Title of <hi>Prima Cohors.</hi> We meet too with the <hi>Praetoria Cohors,</hi> inſtituted by <hi>Scipio Numantinus;</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected for the moſt part out of the <hi>Evocati,</hi> or Reformade's, and oblig'd only to attend on the <hi>Praetor,</hi> or General: And this gave original to the <hi>Praetoriani,</hi> the Life-guard of the Emperours.</p>
                  <p>Ten Cohorts made up a Legion: The exact number of Foot in ſuch a Battalion, <hi>Romulus</hi> fix'd at Three thouſand; though <hi>Plutarch</hi> aſſures us, That after the reception of the <hi>Sabines</hi> into <hi>Rome,</hi> he encreas'd it to Six thouſand.

                  <p>The number of Legions kept in Pay together, was different, according to the various Times and Occaſions.

                  <p>They borrow'd their Names from the Order in which they were rais'd, as <hi>Prima, Secunda, Tertia;</hi> but becauſe it uſually happen'd, that there were ſeveral <hi>Primae, Secundae,</hi> &amp;c. in ſeveral places, upon that account they took a ſort of Surname beſides; either from the Emperours who firſt conſtituted them, as <hi>Auguſta, Claudiana, Galbiana, Flavia, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lpia, Trajana, Antoniana;</hi> or from the Provinces which had been conquer'd chiefly by their Valour; as <hi>Parthica, Scythica, Gallica, Arabica,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>THE Horſe requir'd to every Legion was Three hundred, divided into ten <hi>Turmae,</hi> or Troops; Thirty to a Troop; every <hi>Turma</hi> making Three <hi>Decuriae,</hi> or Bodies of Ten Men. This number of Three hundred they term'd <hi>juſtus Equitatus;</hi> and is underſtood as often as we meet with <hi>Legio cum ſuo equitatu;</hi> or <hi>Legio cum juſto equitatu.</hi> And though we now and then find a different number, as Two hundred in a place or two of <hi>Livy</hi> and <hi>Caeſar;</hi> yet we muſt ſuppoſe this alteration to have proceeded from ſome extraordinary cauſe, and conſequently to be of no Authority againſt the common current of Hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>The foreign Troops, under which we may comprize the <hi>Socii</hi> and Auxiliaries were not divided, as the Citizens, into Legions; but firſt into Two great Bodies, term'd <hi>Alae,</hi> or <hi>Cornua;</hi> and thoſe again into Companies uſually of the ſame nature with thoſe of the <hi>Romans:</hi> Though, as to this, we have little light in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, as a matter of ſmall importance.</p>
                  <p>We may further remark, That the Forces which the <hi>Romans</hi> borrow'd of the Confederate States, were equal to their own in Foot, and double in Horſe; though by diſpoſing and dividing them with great Policy and Caution, they prevented any Deſign that they might poſſibly entertain againſt the natural Forces: For about a third part of the foreign Horſe, and a fifth of the Foot, was ſeparated from the reſt, under the Name of <hi>Extraordinarii;</hi> and a more choice Part of thoſe with the Title of <hi>Ablecti.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the time of the Emperours, the Auxiliary Forces were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly Honour'd with the Name and Conſtitution of Legions, though the more ancient Appellation of <hi>Alae</hi> frequently occurr.

                     <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> The Officers in the <hi>Roman</hi> Army; and firſt of the <hi>Centurions</hi> and <hi>Tribunes;</hi> with the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Horſe, and of the Confederate Forces.</head>
                  <p>THE Military Officers may be divided, according to <hi>Lipſius,</hi> into proper and Common; the firſt preſiding over ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Part, as the <hi>Centurions</hi> and <hi>Tribunes,</hi> the other uſing an equal Authority over the whole force, as the <hi>Legati</hi> and the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
                  <p>We can't have a tolerable Notion of the <hi>Centurions,</hi> without remembring what has been already deliver'd; That every one of the Thirty <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ipuli</hi> in a Legion, was divided into Two <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines,</hi> or <hi>Ranks; and conſequently the Three Bodies of the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtati, Principes,</hi> and <hi>Triarii,</hi> into Twenty Orders a-piece, as into Ten <hi>Manipuli.</hi> Now every <hi>Manipulus</hi> was allow'd Two <hi>Centurions,</hi> or Captains; One to each Order, or Century: And to determine the point of Priority between them, they were created at two different Elections. The Thirty, who were made firſt, always took the Precedency of their Fellows, and therefore commanded the Right-hand Orders, as the others did the Left.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Triarii,</hi> or <hi>Pilani,</hi> being eſteem'd the moſt Honourable, had their <hi>Centurions</hi> elected firſt; next to them the <hi>Principes,</hi> and afterwards the <hi>Haſtati;</hi> whence they were call'd <hi>primus &amp; ſecundus Pilus, primus &amp; ſecundus Princeps, primus &amp; ſecundus Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatus;</hi> and ſo on.</p>
                  <p>Here it may be obſerv'd, That <hi>primi ordines,</hi> is us'd ſometimes in Hiſtorians for the <hi>Centurions</hi> of thoſe Orders; and the ſame <hi>Centurions</hi> are ſometimes ſtyl'd <hi>Principes Ordinum,</hi> and <hi>Principes Centurionum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We may take notice too what a large Field there lay for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion; firſt through all the Orders of the <hi>Haſtati,</hi> then quite through the <hi>Principes;</hi> and afterwards from the laſt Order of the <hi>Triarii,</hi> to the <hi>Primopilus,</hi> the moſt Honourable of the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turions,</hi> and who deſerves to be particularly deſcrib'd.</p>
                  <p>This Officer, beſides his Name of <hi>Primopilus,</hi> went under the ſeveral Titles of <hi>Dux Legionis, Praefectus Legionis, Primus Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rionum,</hi> and <hi>Primus Centurio;</hi> and was the <hi>Centurion</hi> of the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:66439:122"/>Right-hand Order of the firſt <hi>Manipulus</hi> of the <hi>Triarians</hi> or <hi>Pilani,</hi> in every Legion. He preſided over all the other <hi>Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rions;</hi> and, generally, gave the word Command in Exerciſes and Engagements by Order of the <hi>Tribunes.</hi> Beſides this, he had the care of the Eagle, or chief Standard of the Legion: Hence <hi>Aquilae praeeſſe</hi> is to bear the Dignity of <hi>Primopilus;</hi> and hence <hi>Aquila</hi> is taken by <hi>Pliny</hi> for the ſaid Office; and <hi>Juvenal</hi> ſeems to intimate the ſame.</p>

                  <p>Nor was this Station only honorable, but very profitable too; for he had a ſpecial Stipend allow'd him, probably as much as a Knight's Eſtate; and when he left that Charge, was reputed equal to the Members of the Equeſtrian Order, bearing the Title of <hi>Primopilarius;</hi> in the ſame manner as thoſe who had diſcharg'd the greateſt Civil Offices, were ſtyl'd ever after <hi>Conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lares, Cenſorii, Praetorii, Quaeſtorii,</hi> and <hi>Aedilitii.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Badge of the <hi>Centurion</hi>'s Office was the <hi>Vitis</hi> or Rod which they bore in their Hand, whence <hi>vitem poſcere</hi> imports the ſame as to ſue for a <hi>Centurion</hi>'s Place. The <hi>Evocati</hi> too had the Privilege of uſing the <hi>Vitis</hi> as being in all reſpects ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuperiour to the <hi>Centurions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the reaſon why this Rod ſhould be made of a Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branch, an old Scholiaſt upon <hi>Juvenal</hi> has a merry Fancy, that <hi>Bacchus</hi> made uſe of ſuch a Scepter in his Martial Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, and recommended the uſe of it to Poſterity.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the Centurions, every <hi>Manipulus</hi> had two <hi>Vexillarii</hi> or Enſigns; and every Centurion choſe two <hi>Optiones,</hi> or <hi>Succentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riones</hi> to be his Deputies or Lieutenants.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Tribunes</hi> owe their Name and Original to <hi>Romulus</hi> his Inſtitution, when he choſe three Officers in chief of that nature out of the three Tribes into which he divided his City. The number afterwards encreas'd to ſix in every Legion. They were created, as at firſt by the Kings, ſo afterwards by the Conſuls for ſome time, 'till about <hi>A. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>.

'Tis probable, that ſoon after
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:66439:123"/>they divided this Power between them, one half of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes being aſſign'd by the Conſuls, the other half elected by the People.

                  <p>They were ſometimes taken out of the Equeſtrian and Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian Orders: And in the time of the <hi>Caeſars</hi> moſt (if not all) the <hi>Tribunes</hi> ſeem to have been either Senators or Knights: Upon which account they were divided into the <hi>Laticlavii,</hi> and the <hi>Anguſticlavii;</hi> the <hi>latus clavus</hi> properly belonging to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and the <hi>anguſtus clavus</hi> to the latter.</p>
                  <p>The buſineſs of the <hi>Tribunes</hi> was to decide all Controverſies in the Army; to give the Word to the Watch; beſides the care of the Works and Camp, and ſeveral other Particulars which will fall under our notice upon ſome other occaſion.</p>
                  <p>They had the Honour of wearing a Gold Ring in the ſame manner as the <hi>Equites;</hi> and becauſe their Office was extremely deſir'd to encourage and promote as many as poſſible, their Command laſted but ſix Months: For the knowledge of both theſe Cuſtoms we are beholden to one Verſe of <hi>Juvenal, Sat.</hi> 7.</p>

                  <p>Every <hi>Turma,</hi> or Troop of Horſe had three <hi>Decurions,</hi> or Captains of Ten; but he that was firſt elected commanded the Troop, and the others were but his Lieutenants; tho' every one of the <hi>Decurions</hi> had an <hi>Optio</hi> or Deputy under him.</p>
                  <p>As to the Confederate or Foreign Forces, we are not certain how the ſmaller Bodies of them were commanded; but it ſeems moſt probable that the <hi>Romans</hi> generally marſhall'd them according to their own Diſcipline, and aſſign'd them Officers of the ſame nature with thoſe of the Legions. But the two <hi>Alae,</hi> or great Diviſions of the Allies, we are aſſur'd had each a <hi>Praefect</hi> appointed them by the <hi>Roman</hi> Conſul, who govern'd in the ſame manner as the Legionary <hi>Tribunes.</hi>

                  <p>THE Deſign of the <hi>Legati</hi> at their firſt Inſtitution, was not ſo much to command as to adviſe; the Senate ſelecting ſome of the oldeſt and moſt prudent Members to aſſiſt the General in his Counſels. <hi>Dionyſius</hi> calls this <hi>The moſt Honourable and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Office among the</hi> Romans, <hi>bearing not only the Authority of a Commander, but withal the Sanctity and Veneration of a Prieſt</hi>

                  <p>As to the number of the <hi>Legati</hi> we have no certainty; but we may ſuppoſe this to have depended upon the Pleaſure of the General, and upon the nature and conſequence of the Affair in which they were engag'd.

                  <p>Under the Emperours there were two ſorts of <hi>Legati, Conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lares</hi> and <hi>Praetorii;</hi> the firſt of which commanded whole Armies as the Emperour's Lieutenant-Generals; and the other only par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Legions.</p>
                  <p>The General excell'd all other Officers, not only becauſe he had the chief Command of the whole Army, Horſe and Foot, Legions and Auxiliaries; but eſpecially as he was allow'd the <hi>Auſpicia,</hi> or the Honour of taking Omens by help of the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,

In the mean time, the Senate fearing he might venture on ſuch an hazardous attempt, ſent the Tribunes of the Commons with other Officers to deſire <hi>Fabius</hi> that he would not by any means think of ſuch an Enterprize; but not arriving 'till he had effected his deſign, inſtead of hindring his Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they return'd home with the joyful News of his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs<note n="(e)" place="bottom">

                  <p>The ſetting out of the General was attended with great Pomp and Superſtition. The Publick Prayers and Sacrifices for his Succeſs being finiſh'd, he, habited in a rich <hi>Paludamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> a Robe of Purple or Scarlet interweav'd with Gold, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun his March out of the City, accompanied with a vaſt Reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue of all Sexes and Ages; eſpecially if the Expedition was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken againſt any potent or renown'd Adyerſary, all Perſons being deſirous to ſee and follow with their Wiſhes him on whom all their Hopes and Fortunes depended.</p>
                  <p>If it would not be too minute, we might add a deſcription of the General's Led-Horſes, with their rich Trappings of Purple and Cloath of Gold; ſuch as <hi>Dionyſius</hi> tells us they brought to honeſt <hi>Quinctius</hi> the <hi>Dictator,</hi> in lieu of thoſe he had left with his Plough: Or as that of <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great, which <hi>Plutarch</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to have been taken by the Enemy in the War with <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torius.</hi>

                  <p>The old <hi>Romans</hi> had one very Superſtitious Fancy in reference to the General, that if he would conſent to be <hi>devoted</hi> or ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to <hi>Jupiter, Mars,</hi> the Earth, and the Infernal Gods, all the Misfortunes which otherwiſe might have happen'd to his Party, would, by virtue of that pious Act, be transferr'd on their Enemies. This Opinion was confirm'd by ſeveral ſucceſsful Inſtances, and particularly in the moſt renown'd Family of the <hi>Decii;</hi> of whom, the Father, Son, and Grandſon, all <hi>devoted</hi> themſelves for the ſafety of their Armies: The firſt being Conſul with <hi>Manlius</hi> in the War againſt the <hi>Latines;</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Left Wing, which he commanded, to give back, he call'd out to <hi>Valerius</hi> the High-Prieſt to perform on him the Ceremony of Conſecration, (which we find deſcrib'd by <hi>Livy</hi> in his eighth Book) and immediately ſpurr'd his Horſe into the thickeſt of the Enemies Forces, where he was kill'd, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Army gain'd the Battel. His Son died in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the <hi>Tuſcan</hi> War, and his Grandſon in the War with <hi>Pyrrbus;</hi> in both which the <hi>Romans</hi> were ſucceſsful. <hi>Juvenal</hi> has left them this deſerv'd Encomium in his eighth Satyr.</p>

                  <p>It ſeems probable that after the time when the <hi>Socii</hi> were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions, the particular Order of the <hi>Velites</hi> was diſcontinued, and ſome of the youngeſt Soldiers were choſe out upon occaſion to skirmiſh before the main Body. Hence we find among the Light Forces in the times of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, the <hi>Sagiotarii</hi> and <hi>Funditores,</hi> the Darters and Slin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, who never conſtituted any part of the proper <hi>Velites.</hi> And ſo before the inſtitution of the <hi>Velites,</hi> we meet with the <hi>Recarii,</hi> and the <hi>Accenſi,</hi> whom <hi>Salluſt</hi> calls <hi>Ferentarii,</hi> who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorm'd the ſame Duty with ſeveral ſorts of Weapons.</p>
                  <p>The Arms of the <hi>Haſtati, Prineipes</hi> and <hi>Triarii</hi> were in a great meaſure the ſame, and therefore <hi>Polybius</hi> has not divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them in his Deſcription, but ſpeaks of them all together.</p>

                  <p>Their Sword was the ſame as that of the <hi>Velites;</hi> nor need we obſerve any thing more about it, only that the <hi>Roman</hi> Soldiers us'd commonly to wear it on their Right ſide, tho' they are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repreſented otherwiſe in ancient Monuments.</p>
                  <p>Their other Arms, worth our notice, were the <hi>Scutum,</hi> the <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum,</hi> the <hi>Galea,</hi> and the <hi>Lorica.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Scutum</hi> was a Buckler of Wood, the parts being joined together with little Plates of Iron, and the whole cover'd with a Bull's Hide: An Iron Plate went about it without to keep off Blows, and another within to hinder it from taking any damage by lying on the Ground: In the middle was an Iron Boſs or <hi>

                     <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> The Order of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army drawn up in Battalia.</head>
                  <p>WHEN the Officers martial'd the Army in order to an an Engagement, the <hi>Haſtati</hi> were plac'd in the Front in thick and firm Ranks; the <hi>Principes</hi> behind them; but not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſo cloſe; and after them the <hi>Triarii,</hi> in ſo wide and looſe an Order, that, upon occaſion, they could receive both the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipes</hi> and the <hi>Haſtati</hi> into their Body in any diſtreſs. The <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> and in later times the Bowmen and Slingers, were not drawn up in this regular manner, but diſpos'd of either before the Front of the <hi>Haſtati,</hi> or ſcatter'd up and down among the void ſpaces of the ſame <hi>Haſtati;</hi> or ſometimes plac'd in two Bodies in the Wings. But where-ever they were fix'd, theſe Light-Soldiers began the Combat, skirmiſhing in flying Parties with the firſt Troops of the Enemy: If they prevail'd, which very ſeldom happen'd, they proſecuted the Victory; but upon a Repulſe they fell back by the Flanks of the Army, or rallied again the Rear. When they were retir'd, the <hi>Haſtati</hi> advanc'd againſt the Enemy; and in caſe they found themſelves over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power'd, retiring ſoftly toward the <hi>Principes,</hi> fell into the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals of their Ranks, and, together with them, renew'd the Fight. But if the <hi>Principes</hi> and the <hi>Haſtati</hi> thus join'd, were too weak to ſuſtain the Fury of the Battel, they all fell back into the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der intervals of the <hi>Triarii;</hi> and then all together being united into a firm Maſs, they made another Effort, much more impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than any before: If this Aſſault prov'd ineffectual, the Day was entirely loſt as to the Foot, there being no farther Reſerves.</p>
                  <p>This way of martialling the Foot, was exactly like the Order of Trees, which Gardiners call the <hi>Quincunx;</hi> which is admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably compar'd to it in <hi>Virgil</hi>
                     <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Georg. 2.</note>. And as the reaſon of that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Trees is not only for Beauty and Show, but that every particular Tree may have room to ſpread its Root and Boughs, without entangling and hindring the reſt; ſo, in this
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:66439:127"/>ranking of the Men, the Army was not only ſet out to the beſt advantage, and made the greateſt ſhow, but too every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Soldier had free room to uſe his Weapons, and to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw himſelf between the void ſpaces behind him, without occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioning any confuſion or diſturbance.</p>
                  <p>The Stratagem of reinforcing thus three times, has been rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd almoſt the whole Art and Secret of the <hi>Roman</hi> Diſcipline; and 'twas almoſt impoſſible it ſhou'd prove unſucceſsful, if duly obſerv'd: For Fortune, in every Engagement, muſt have fail'd them three ſeveral times, before they could be routed; and the Enemy muſt have had the Strength and Reſolution to overcome them in three ſeveral Encounters, for the deciſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>on of one Battel; whereas moſt other Nations, and even the <hi>Grecians</hi> themſelves, drawing up their whole Army, as it were, into one Front, truſted themſelves and Fortunes to the Succeſs of a ſingle Charge.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Cavalry was poſted at the two Corners of the Army, like the Wings on a Body, and ſought ſometimes on foot, ſometimes on horſe-back, as occaſion requir'd, in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as our Dragoons. The Confederate, or Auxiliary-Forces, compos'd the Two <hi>Points</hi> of the <hi>Battel,</hi> and cover'd the whole Body of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the Stations of the Commanders, the General commonly took up his Poſt near the middle of the Army, between the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipes</hi> and the <hi>Triarii,</hi> as the fitteſt place to give Orders equally to all the Troops.

                  <p>The <hi>Legati</hi> and the <hi>Tribunes</hi> were uſually poſted by him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the former were order'd to Command the Wings, or the others ſome particular Part of the Army.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Centurions</hi> ſtood every Man at the head of his Century to lead them up; though ſometimes, out of Courage and Honour, they expos'd themſelves in the Van of the Army: As <hi>Salluſt</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of <hi>Catiline,</hi> That he poſted all his choice <hi>Centurions,</hi> with the <hi>Evocati,</hi> and the Flower of the Common Soldiers, in the front of the Battel: But the <hi>Primipili,</hi> or Chief <hi>Centurions,</hi> had the Honour to ſtand with the <hi>Tribunes,</hi> near the General's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p>The common Soldiers, were plac'd in the ſeveral Ranks, at the diſcretion of the <hi>Centurions,</hi> according to their Age, Strength, and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:66439:128"/>Experience; every Man having three foot ſquare allow'd him to manage his Arms in: And 'twas moſt religiouſly obſerv'd in their Diſcipline, never to abandon their Ranks, or break their Order upon any account.</p>
                  <p>But beſides the common methods of drawing up their Army, which are ſufficiently explain'd by every Hiſtorian of any Note, there were ſeveral other very ſingular methods of forming their Battel into odd Shapes, according to the nature of the Enemy's Body. Such as</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Cuneus,</hi> when an Army was rang'd in the figure of a Wedge, or Triangle, the moſt proper to pierce and break the Orders of the Enemy. This was otherwiſe call'd <hi>Caput por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinum,</hi> which in ſome meaſure it reſembled.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Globus,</hi> when the Soldiers caſt themſelves into a firm round Body, practis'd uſually in caſes of extremity.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Forfex,</hi> an Army drawn up as it were into the form of a pair of Sheers. It ſeems to have been invented on purpoſe to receive the <hi>Cuneus,</hi> in caſe the Enemy ſhou'd make uſe of that Figure: For while he endeavour'd to open, and, as it were, to cleave their Squadrons with his Wedge, by keeping their Troops open like the Sheers, and receiving him in the middle, they not only hinder'd the Damage deſign'd to their own Men, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly cut the adverſe Body in pieces.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Turris,</hi> an oblong ſquare Figure, after the faſhion of a Tower, with very few Men in a File, and the Files extended to a great length. This ſeems of very ancient original, as being mention'd in <hi>Homer:</hi>

                  <p>As to the Enſigns, they were either proper to the Foot, or to the Horſe. Enſigns belonging to the Foot, were either the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon one of the whole Legion, or the particular ones of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Manipuli.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The common Enſign of the whole Legion, was an Eagle of Gold or Silver, fix'd on the top of a Spear, holding a Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt in his Talons, as ready to deliver it. That this was not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the <hi>Romans,</hi> is evident from the Teſtimony of <hi>Xenophon;</hi> who informs us, That the Royal Enſign of <hi>Cyrus</hi> was a golden Eagle ſpread over a Shield, and faſtned on a Spear; and that the ſame was ſtill us'd by the <hi>Perſian</hi> Kings<note n="(a)" place="bottom">De Inſtit. <hi>Cyri,</hi> lib. 7.</note>.</p>
                  <p>What the Enſigns of the <hi>Manipuli</hi> formerly were, the very Word points out to us; for, as <hi>Ovid</hi> expreſſes it.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Pertica ſuſpenſos portabat longa Maniplos,</l>
                     <l>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nde Maniplaris nomina miles habet.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Manipulus</hi> properly ſignifying a Wiſp of Hay, ſuch as in ruder times the Soldiers carried on a Pole for an Enſign.</p>
                  <p>But this was in the ruſtick Age of <hi>Rome;</hi> afterwards they made uſe of a Spear with a tranſverſe piece on the top, almoſt like a Croſs; and ſometimes with a Hand on the top, in alluſion to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipulus;</hi> below the tranſverſe part was faſtned one little orbicular Shield; or more, in which they ſometimes placed the ſmaller Images of the Gods, and in later times of the Emperours. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus</hi>
                     <pb n="202" facs="tcp:66439:129"/>order'd a Globe faſtned on the head of a Spear to ſerve for this Uſe, in token of the Conqueſt of the whole World.</p>
                  <p>The Enſign of the Horſe was not ſolid as the others, but a Cloth almoſt like our Colours, ſpreading on a Staff: On theſe were commonly the Names of the Emperours, in Golden or Purple Letters.</p>
                  <p>The religious Care the Soldiers took of the Enſigns, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary; they worſhipp'd them, ſwore by them, and incurr'd certain death if they loſt them. Hence 'twas an uſual Stratagem in a dubious Engagement, for the Commanders to ſnatch the Enſigns out of the Bearers hands, and throw them among the Troops of the Enemy, knowing that their Men wou'd venture the extreameſt Danger to recover them.</p>
                  <p>As for the ſeveral kinds of Standards and Banners, introduc'd by the later Emperours juſt before Chriſtianity, and afterwards, they do not fall under the preſent Enquiry, which is confin'd to the more flouriſhing and vigorous Ages of the Common-wealth.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> us'd only Wind-Muſick in their Army; the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments which ſerv'd for that purpoſe, may be diſtinguiſh'd into the <hi>Tuba,</hi> the <hi>Cornua,</hi> the <hi>Buccinae,</hi> and the <hi>Litui.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Tuba</hi> is ſuppos'd to have been exactly like our Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, running on wider and wider in a direct Line to the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Cornua</hi> were bended almoſt round; they owe their Name and Original to the old Horns of Beaſts, put to the ſame uſe in the ruder Ages.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Buccinae</hi> ſeem to have had the ſame riſe, and may derive their Name from <hi>Bos</hi> and <hi>Cano.</hi> 'Tis very hard to diſtinguiſh theſe from the <hi>Cornua,</hi> unleſs they were ſomething leſs, and not quite ſo crooked: Yet 'tis moſt certain that they were of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Species; becauſe we never read of the <hi>Cornua</hi> in uſe with the Watch, or Sentinels, but only theſe <hi>Buccinae.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Litui</hi> were a middle kind between the <hi>Cornua</hi> and the <hi>Tuba,</hi> being almoſt ſtraight, only a little turning in at the top, like the <hi>Lituus,</hi> or ſacred Rod of the <hi>Augur,</hi> whence they borrow'd their Name.</p>

                  <p>Beſides this <hi>Claſſicum,</hi> or Alarm, the Soldiers gave a general Shout at the firſt Encounter, which in later Ages they call'd <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus,</hi> from ſome <hi>German</hi> Original.</p>
                  <p>This Cuſtom ſeems to have roſe from an Inſtinct of Nature, and is attributed almoſt to all Nations that engag'd in any Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Action; as, by <hi>Homer</hi> to the <hi>Trojans;</hi> by <hi>Tacitus</hi> to the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi> by <hi>Livy</hi> to the <hi>Gauls;</hi> by <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi> to the <hi>Mac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Polyaenus</hi> honours <hi>Pan</hi> with the invention of the Device, when he was Lieutenant-General to <hi>Bacchus</hi> in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Expedition; and, if ſo, we have a very good Original for the <hi>Terrores Panici,</hi> or <hi>Panick Fears,</hi> which might well be the conſequence of ſuch a diſmal and ſurprizing Clamour. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> made one addition to this Cuſtom, at the ſame time claſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Arms with great violence, to improve the Strength and Terrour of the Noiſe. This they call'd <hi>concuſſio Armorum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Signs of Battel, beſides the <hi>Claſſicum,</hi> were either a Flag, or Standard, erected for that purpoſe, which <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in two ſeveral places, calls a <hi>Purple Robe;</hi> or more properly ſome Word or Sentence communicated by the General to the Chief Officers, and by them to the whole Army. This commonly contain'd ſome good Omen; as, <hi>Felicitas, Libertas, Victoria, Fortuna C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaris,</hi> and the like; or elſe the Name of ſome Deity, as <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> us'd <hi>Venus Genetrix;</hi> and <hi>Auguſius, Apollo.</hi> The old <hi>Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſera</hi> put to this uſe, ſeems to have been a ſort of Tally, deliver'd to every Soldier to diſtinguiſh him from the Enemy; and perhaps on that they us'd to inſcribe ſome particular Word, or Sentence, which afterwards they made uſe of without the Tally.</p>
                  <p>One great Encouragement which the Soldiers receiv'd in the entrance on any Adventure, was from the Harangue of the General; who upon the undertaking an Enterprize, had a Throne erected with green Turf, ſurrounded with the <hi>Faſces,</hi> Enſigns, and other Military Ornaments; from whence he addreſs'd himſelf to the Army, put them in mind of the noble Atchievements of their Anceſtors, told them their own Strength, and explain'd to them the Order and Forces of the Enemy; raiſing their Hopes with the glorious Rewards of Honour and Victory, and diſſipating their Fears by all the Arguments that a natural Courage and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:66439:131"/>could ſuggeſt. This Cuſtom, tho' now laid aſide as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquated and uſeleſs, is yet highly commended in the ancient Diſcipline, and without doubt has been often the cauſe of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Succeſſes, and the means of ſtiffing Sedition, hindring raſh Action, and preventing many unfortunate Diſorders in the Field.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> The Form and Diviſion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp.</head>
                  <p>THE <hi>Romans</hi> were more exact in nothing than in forming their Camp; and two very great Commanders <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> and King <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> upon view of their admirable Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Contrivance herein, are reported to have expreſs'd the greateſt Admiration imaginable of the <hi>Roman</hi> Art, and to have thought them more than <hi>Barbarians,</hi> as the <hi>Grecians</hi> term'd all People beſides themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Before we take a particular Proſpect of the Camp, we had beſt diſtinguiſh between the <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſtra Aeſtiva,</hi> and <hi>Caſtra Hiberna:</hi> The former were ſometimes light and moveable, ſo that they might be ſet up or took down in a Night, and then they call'd them ſimply <hi>Caſtra.</hi> At other times, when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to continue long in their Encampments, they took more pains to fortiſie and regulate them, for the Convenience and Defence of their Men; and then they term'd them <hi>Caſtra Stativa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Hiberna,</hi> or Winter-Quarters, they were common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken up in ſome City or Town, or elſe ſo built, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd as to make almoſt a Town of themſelves. And hence the Antiquarians obſerve, that the Modern Towns whoſe Names end in <hi>ceſter,</hi> were originally theſe <hi>Caſtra Hiberna</hi> of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Figure of the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp was four-ſquare, divided into two chief Partitions, the Upper and the Lower. In the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Partition were the Pavilion of the General, and the Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the chief Officers: In the Lower were diſpos'd the Tents of the common Soldiers, Horſe and Foot.</p>

                  <p>The General's Apartment, which they call'd <hi>Praetorium</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ancient <hi>Latines</hi> ſtyl'd all their Commanders <hi>Praetores</hi>) ſeems to have been of a round Figure: The chief parts of it were the <hi>Tribunal,</hi> or General's Pavilion; the <hi>Augurale</hi> ſet aſide for Prayers, Sacrifices, and other Religious Uſes; the Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the young Noblemen who came under the care of the General, to inform themſelves in the nature of the Countries, and to gain ſome Experience in Military Affairs: Theſe Gentlemen had the honourable Title of <hi>Imperatoris Contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>On the other ſide of the <hi>Praetorium</hi> were lodg'd the <hi>Legati,</hi> or Lieutenant-Generals: And below the <hi>Praetorium</hi> the Tribunes took up their Quarters by ſix and ſix, oppoſite to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Legions, to the end they might the better govern and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Praefecti</hi> of the Foreign Troops were lodg'd at the ſides of the Tribunes, over-againſt their reſpective Wings: Behind theſe were the Lodgments of the <hi>Evocati,</hi> and then thoſe of the <hi>Extraordinarii</hi> and <hi>Ablecti equites,</hi> which concluded the higher part of the Camp.</p>
                  <p>Between the two Partitions was included a Spot of Ground about an hundred Foot in length, which they call'd <hi>Principia,</hi> where the Altars and Statues of the Gods, and (perhaps) the chief Enſigns were fix'd all together.</p>
                  <p>The middle of the lower Partition, as the moſt Honourable Place, was aſſign'd to the <hi>Roman</hi> Horſe; and next to them were quarter'd the <hi>Triarii,</hi> then the <hi>Principes;</hi> cloſe by them the <hi>Haſtati;</hi> afterwards the Foreign Horſe; and in the laſt place the Foreign Foot.</p>
                  <p>But the Form and Dimenſions of the Camp, can't be ſo well deſcrib'd any other way as in a Table where they are expos'd to view. However we may remark two great pieces of Policy in the way of diſpoſing the Confederate Forces: For in the firſt place, they divided the whole Body of Foreigners, placing part in the higheſt Partition of the Camp, and part in the lower; and then the matter was order'd ſo, that they ſhould be ſpread in thin Ranks round the Troops of the State; ſo that the latter, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing the middle ſpace, remain'd firm and ſolid, while the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:66439:133"/>others were Maſters of very little ſtrength, being ſeparated ſo vaſt a diſtance from one another, and lying juſt on the Skirts of the Army.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> fortified their Camp with a Ditch and Parapet, which they term'd <hi>Foſſa</hi> and <hi>Vallum;</hi> in the laſt ſome diſtinguiſh two Parts, the <hi>Agger</hi> and the <hi>Sudes.</hi> The <hi>Agger</hi> was no more than the Earth caſt up to form the <hi>Vallum;</hi> and the <hi>Sudes</hi> were a ſort of woodden Stakes to ſecure and ſtrengthen it.</p>

                  <p>THE Duties and Works of the Soldiers conſiſted chiefly in their Watches and Guards, and their diligence in caſting up Intrenchments and Ramparts, and ſuch other laborious Services.</p>
                  <p>The Watches and Guards were divided into the <hi>Excubiae,</hi> and the <hi>Vigiliae:</hi> the firſt kept by Day, the other by Night.</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>Excubiae,</hi> they were kept either in the Camp, or at the Gates and Intrenchments. For the former there was allow'd a whole <hi>Manipulus</hi> to attend before the <hi>Praetorium;</hi> and four Soldiers to the Tent of every <hi>Tril<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Triarii,</hi> as the moſt honourable Order, were excus'd from the ordinary Watches; yet being plac'd exactly oppoſite <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o the <hi>Equites,</hi> they were oblig'd to have an Eye over their Horſes.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Excubiae,</hi> at the Gates of the Camp, and at the Intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they properly call'd <hi>Stationes.</hi> There ſeem to have been aſſign'd one Company of Foot and one Troop of Horſe to each of the four Gates every Day. And 'twas a moſt unpardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Crime to deſert their Poſt, or to abandon their Corps of Guards. The excellency of the <hi>Roman</hi> Diſcipline in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular has appear'd on many occaſions to their great Honour, and to the benefit of their Affairs. To give one inſtance: At the Siege of <hi>Agrigentum</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> in the firſt <hi>Punick</hi> War, when the <hi>Roman</hi> Guards had diſpers'd themſelves abroad a little farther than they ought into the Fields for Forage; and the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> laying hold on the opportunity, made a vigorous Sally
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:66439:133"/>from the Town, and in all probability would have forc'd the Camp; the Soldiers, who had careleſly neglected their Duty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſenſible of the extreme Penalty they had incurr'd, reſolv'd to repair the Fault by ſome remarkable Behaviour; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly rallying together, they not only ſuſtain'd the Shock of the Enemy, to whom they were far inferiour in number, but in the end made ſo great a ſlaughter among them, as compell'd them to retreat to their Works, when they had well-nigh forc'd the <hi>Roman</hi> Lines<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Vide <hi>Polyb.</hi> lib. 1.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The Night-guards aſſign'd to the General and Tribunes, were of the ſame nature as thoſe in the Day. But the proper <hi>Vigiles</hi> were four in every <hi>Manipulus,</hi> keeping Guard three Hours, and then reliev'd by four others: So that there were four Sets in a Night, according to the four Watches, which took their Name from this Cuſtom.</p>
                  <p>The way of ſetting this nightly Guard was by a Tally or <hi>Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſera,</hi> with a particular Inſcription given from one Centurion to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother quite through the Army, 'till it came again to the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune who at firſt deliver'd it. Upon the receipt of this the Guard was immediately ſet. The Perſon deputed to carry the <hi>Teſſera</hi> from the Tribunes to the Centurions was call'd <hi>Teſſerarius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But becauſe this was not a ſufficient regulation of the Buſineſs, they had the <hi>Circuitio Vigilium,</hi> or a viſiting the Watch, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd commonly about four times in the Night by ſome of the Horſe. Upon extraordinary occaſions the Tribunes and Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-Generals, and ſometimes the General himſelf, made theſe Circuits in Perſon, and took a ſtrict view of the Watch in every part of the Camp.</p>

                  <p>THE <hi>Roman</hi> Pay conſiſted of three Parts, Money, Corn, and Cloaths.</p>
                  <p>As to the Money 'tis very certain, that for above three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years together the Army ſerv'd <hi>gratis,</hi> and at their own Charge; and when afterwards a certain Pay came to be eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, it was no more than two <hi>Oboli</hi> a Day to the common Foot, and to the inferiour Officers, and the Centurions four <hi>Oboli;</hi> to the Horſe a <hi>Drachma</hi> a-piece. 'Tis probable, that the Tribunes receiv'd what was counted very conſiderable (tho' <hi>Polybius</hi> is ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in this matter) ſince in ſeveral Authors we find a large Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary expreſs'd by a Metaphor taken from a Tribunes Stipend: Thus <hi>Juvenal</hi> particularly:

                  <p>Beſides the Pay receiv'd in Money, we read of Corn and Cloaths often given to the Soldiers: But <hi>Polybius</hi> aſſures us, that the <hi>Quaeſtor</hi> always ſubſtracted ſome part of their Pay on that account: And <hi>Plutarch,</hi> among the popular Laws of <hi>C.

The Wheat allow'd to the Foot was every Man four <hi>Modii</hi> a Month, to the Horſe two <hi>Modii,</hi> and ſeven of Barley.</p>
                  <p>It was common for the Soldiers, eſpecially in the time of the ſtrict Diſcipline, to prepare their Corn themſelves for their own uſe; and therefore ſome carried Hand-Mills about with them to grind it with; others pounded it with Stones; and this haſtily bak'd upon the Coals, very often furniſh'd them with a Meal, which they made upon Tables of Turf, with no other Drink than bare Water, or what they call'd <hi>Poſca,</hi> Water ſharpen'd with a mixture of Vinegar.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> Of the Military Puniſhments.</head>
                  <p>THE Puniſhments us'd in the Camp, were ſuch as reach'd either the Offender's Body, Credit, or Goods. The Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Puniſhments were uſually beaten with the <hi>Vites,</hi> or Rods, or baſtinading with the <hi>Fuſtes:</hi> The laſt, tho' already reckon'd up among the Civil Puniſhments which did not touch the Life of the Malefactor; yet in the Camp it was for the moſt part Capital, and was perform'd after this manner. The convicted Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon being brought before the <hi>Tribune,</hi> was by him gently ſtruck over the Shoulders with a Staff: After this the Criminal had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to run, but at the ſame time the reſt of the Soldiers had liberty to kill him if they could: So that being perſecuted with Swords, Darts, Stones, and all manner of Weapons on every hand, he was preſently diſpatch'd. This Penalty was incurr'd by ſtealing any thing out of the Camp; by giving falſe Evidence; by abandoning their Poſt in a Battel; by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending falſely to have done ſome great Exploit, out of hopes of a Reward; by fighting without the General's Order; by lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their Weapons; or by aggravating a Miſdemeanour leſs than either of theſe, by repeating it three times.</p>
                  <p>If a great number had offended, as by running from their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, mutinying, or other general Crimes, the common way of proceeding to Juſtice was by <hi>Decimation,</hi> or putting all the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal's Names together in a Shield or Veſſel, and drawing them out by Lot, every tenth Man being to die without Reprieve, commonly in the manner juſt now deſcrib'd; ſo that by this means, tho' all were not alike ſenſible of the Puniſhment; yet all were frighted into Obedience. In later Authors we meet ſometimes with <hi>Viceſimatio,</hi> and <hi>Centeſimatio,</hi> which Words ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently explain themſelves.</p>
                  <p>The Puniſhments which reached no farther than their Credit, by expoſing them to publick Shame, were ſuch as theſe: De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grading them from a higher Station to a lower; giving them a ſet quantity of Barley inſtead of Wheat; ungirding them, and
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:66439:137"/>taking away their Belt; making them ſtand all Supper-time, while the reſt ſat down; and ſuch other little Marks of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe, <hi>Agellius</hi> has recorded a very ſingular Puniſhment, by letting the Delinquent Blood: His Judgment concerning the original of this Cuſtom is to this purpoſe: He fanſies that in elder times this us'd to be preſcrib'd to the drowſie and ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh Soldiers, rather as a Phyſical Remedy than a Puniſhment; and that in after Ages it might have been applied in moſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Faults, upon this Conſideration, That all thoſe who did not obſerve the Rules of their Diſcipline, were to be look'd upon as ſtupid or mad; and for Perſons in thoſe Conditions Blood-letting is commonly ſucceſsful<note n="(a)" place="bottom">

But becauſe this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is hardly ſatisfactory, the great Critick <hi>Muretus</hi> has oblig'd us with another, believing the deſign of this Cuſtom to have been, that thoſe mean-ſpirited Wretches might loſe that Blood with ſhame and diſgrace, which they dar'd not ſpend nobly and honourably in the Service of their Country<note n="(b)" place="bottom">

                  <p>As for the Puniſhments relating to their Goods and Money, the Tribunes might for ſeveral Faults impoſe a Fine on the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents, and force them to give a Pledge in caſe they could not pay. Sometimes too they ſtopp'd the Stipend; whence they were call'd, by way of reproach, <hi>Aere diruti.</hi>

                  <p>BUT the Encouragements of Valour and Induſtry were much more conſiderable than the Proceedings againſt the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Vices.

                     <hi>Plutarch</hi> has gueſs'd very happily at the reaſon why the Branches of this Tree ſhould be made uſe of before all others.

                  <p>The <hi>Supplicatio</hi> was a ſolemn Proceſſion to the Temple of the Gods to return thanks for any ſignal Victory.

But thoſe who without force, by Benevolence and civil Behaviour, had done the Buſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But whatever other difference there lay between theſe two So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities, we are aſſur'd the Triumph was much the more noble and ſplendid Proceſſion.

This Triumph laſted three Days: On the firſt, which was ſcarce long enough for the Sight, was to be ſeen the Statues, Pictures, and Images of an extraordinary bigneſs, which were taken from the Enemy, drawn upon Seven hundred and fifty Chariots. On the ſecond was carried, in a great many Wains, the faireſt and the richeſt Armour of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> both of Braſs and Steel, all newly furbiſh'd and glittering; which although pil'd up with the greateſt Art and Order, yet ſeem'd to be tumbled on heaps careleſly and by chance; Helmets were thrown on Shields, Coats of Mail upon Greaves, <hi>Cretian</hi> Targets, and <hi>Thracian</hi> Bucklers and Quivers of Arrows lay hudled among the Horſes Bitts; and through theſe appear'd the Points of naked Swords, intermix'd with long Spears. All theſe Arms were ty'd together with ſuch a juſt liberty, that they knock'd againſt one another as they were drawn along, and made a harſh and terrible noiſe; ſo that the very Spoils of the Conquer'd cou'd not be beheld without dread. After theſe Waggons loaden with Armour, there follow'd Three thouſand Men, who carried the Silver that was coin'd, in Seven hundred and fifty Veſſels, each of which weigh'd three Talents, and was carried by four Men. Others brought Silver Bowls, and Goblets, and Cups, all diſpos'd in ſuch order as to make the beſt Show; and all valuable, as well for their bigneſs, as the thickneſs of their engraved Work. On the third Day early in the Morning, firſt came the Trumpeters, who did not ſound as they were wont in a Proceſſion or ſolemn Entry, but ſuch a Charge as the <hi>Romans</hi> uſe when they encourage their Soldiers to fight. Next follow'd young Men girt about with Girdles curiouſly wrought, which led to the Sacrifice Sixſcore ſtall'd Oxen, with their Horns gilded, and their Heads adorn'd with Ribbands and Garlands; and with theſe were Boys that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Platters of Silver and Gold. After this was brought the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:66439:142"/>Gold Coin, which was divided into Veſſels that weigh'd three Talents, like to thoſe that contain'd the Silver; they were in number Fourſcore wanting three. Theſe were follow'd by thoſe that brought the conſecrated Bowl, which <hi>Aemylius</hi> caus'd to be made, that weigh'd ten Talents, and was all beſet with precious Stones: Then were expos'd to view the Cups of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonus</hi> and <hi>Seleucus,</hi> and ſuch as were made after the faſhion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by <hi>Thericles,</hi> and all the Gold-Plate that was us'd at <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeus</hi>'s Table. Next to theſe came <hi>Perſeus</hi>'s Chariot, in the which his Armour was plac'd, and on that his Diadem: And, after a little intermiſſion, the King's Children were led Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptives, and with them a Train of Nurſes, Maſters, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, who all wept, and ſtretch'd forth their Hands to the Spectators, and taught the little Infants to beg and entreat their Compaſſion. There were two Sons and a Daughter, who by reaſon of their tender Age, were altogether inſenſible of the greatneſs of their Miſery; which inſenſibility of their Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, rendred it much more deplorable; inſomuch, that <hi>Perſeus</hi> himſelf was ſcarce regarded as he went along, whilſt Pity had fix'd the Eyes of the <hi>Romans</hi> upon the Infants; and many of them cou'd not forbear Tears: All beheld the Sight with a mixture of Sorrow and Joy, until the Children were paſt. After his Children and their Attendants came <hi>Perſeus</hi> himſelf, clad all in black, and wearing Slippers after the faſhion of his Country: He look'd like one altogether aſtoniſh'd and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of Reaſon, through the greatneſs of his Misfortunes. Next follow'd a great Company of his Friends and Familiars, whoſe Countenances were disfigur'd with Grief, and who teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to all that beheld them by their Tears, and their continual looking upon <hi>Perſeus,</hi> that it was his hard Fortune they ſo much lamented, and that they were regardleſs of their own.— After theſe were carried Four hundred Crowns all made of Gold, and ſent from the Cities by their reſpective Ambaſſadors to <hi>Aemylius,</hi> as a Reward due to his Valour. Then he himſelf came ſeated on a Chariot magnificently adorn'd (a Man worthy to be beheld even without theſe Enſigns of Power;) He was clad in a Garment of Purple interwoven with Gold, and held out a Laurel-Branch in his Right-hand. All the Army in like manner, with Boughs of Laurel in their Hands, divided into Bands and Companies, follow'd the Chariot of their Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſome ſinging Odes (according to the uſual Cuſto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="221" facs="tcp:66439:142"/>of <hi>Aemylius</hi>'s Deeds, who was admir'd, and accounted happy by all Men, and unenvy'd by every one that was good.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There was one remarkable Addition to this Solemnity, which, though it ſeldom happen'd, yet ought not to eſcape our notice: This was when the <hi>Roman</hi> General had, in any Engagement, kill'd the Chief Commander of the Enemy with his own Hands; for then, in the Triumphal Pomp, the Arms of the ſlain Captain were carried before the Victor, decently hanging on the Stock of an Oak, and ſo compoſing a Trophy. In this manner the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion was led on to the Temple of <hi>Jupiter Feretrius</hi> (ſo call'd <hi>à feriendo</hi>); and there the General making a formal Dedication of his Spoils (the <hi>Spolia opima,</hi> as they term'd them) hung them up in the Temple. The firſt who perform'd this Gallant piece of Religion, was <hi>Romulus,</hi> when he had ſlain <hi>Acron,</hi> King of the <hi>Coeninenſes;</hi> the ſecond <hi>Cornelius Coſſus,</hi> with the Arms of <hi>Tolum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> a General of the <hi>Veientes;</hi> the third and laſt <hi>M.

                  <p>The Admirers of the <hi>Roman</hi> Magnificence will be infinitely pleas'd with the Relation already given from <hi>Plutarch</hi> of the Triumphal Pomp: while others, who fanſie that People to have been poſſeſs'd with a ſtrange meaſure of vain-glory, and attribute all their Military State and Grandeur to an ambitions Oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will be much better ſatisfied with the ſatyrical Account which <hi>Juvenal</hi> furniſheth us with, in his Tenth Satyr.

                     <hi>CHAP. XVII.</hi> The <hi>Roman</hi> Way of declaring War, and of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Leagues.</head>
                  <p>THE <hi>Romans</hi> us'd abundance of Superſtition in entring upon any Hoſtility, or cloſing in any League, or Confederacy: The Publick Miniſters who perform'd the Ceremonial Part of both theſe, were the <hi>Feciales,</hi> or Heralds, already deſcrib'd among the Prieſts; nothing remains, but the Ceremonies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which were of this nature: When any neighbouring State had given ſufficient reaſon for the <hi>Senate</hi> to ſuſpect a Deſign of breaking with them; or had offer'd any Violence or Injuſtice to the Subjects of <hi>Rome,</hi> which was enough to give them the repute of Enemies; one of the <hi>Feciales,</hi> choſen out of the College on this occaſion, and habited in the Veſt belonging to his Order, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his other Enſigns and Habiliments, ſet forward for the Enemy's Country. As ſoon as he reach'd the Confines, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd a formal Declaration of the cauſe of his arrival, calling all the Gods to witneſs, and imprecating the Divine Vengeance on himſelf and his Country, if his Reaſons were not juſt. When he came to the chief City of the Enemy, he again repeated the ſame Declaration, with ſome addition, and withal deſired ſatisfaction. If they deliver'd into his Power the Authors of the Injury, or gave Hoſtages for ſecurity, he return'd ſatisfied to <hi>Rome;</hi> if, otherwiſe they deſired time to conſider, he went away for ten Days, and then came again to hear their Reſolution. And this he did, in ſome caſes, three times: But if nothing was done toward an Accommodation in about thirty Days, he declar'd that the <hi>Romans</hi> wou'd endeavour to aſſert their Right by their Arms. After this, the Herald was oblig'd to return, and to make a true Report of his Ambaſſie before the <hi>Senate,</hi> aſſuring them of the Legality of the War, which they were now conſulting to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake; and was then again diſpatch'd to perform the laſt part of the Ceremony, which was to throw a Spear into (or towards) the Enemy's Country, in token of Defiance, and as a Summons
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:66439:144"/>to War, pronouncing at the ſame time a ſet Form of Words to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>As to the making of Leagues, <hi>Polybins</hi> acquaints us, That the Ratification of the Articles of an Agreement between the <hi>Romans</hi> and the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> was perform'd in this manner: The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> ſwore by the Gods of their Country; and the <hi>Romans,</hi> after their ancient Cuſtom, ſwore by a <hi>Stone,</hi> and then by <hi>Mars.</hi> They ſwore by a <hi>Stone</hi> thus: The Herald who took the Oath having ſworn in behalf of the Publick, takes up a Stone, and then pronounceth theſe Words:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If I keep my Faith, may the Gods vouchſafe their Aſſistance, and give me ſucceſs; if, on the contrary, I violate it, then may the other Party be entirely ſafe, and preſerv'd in their Country, in their Laws, in their Poſſeſſions, and, in a word, in all their Rights and Liberties; and may I periſh and fall alone as now this Stone does.</hi> And then he lets the Stone fall out of his Hands<note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Polyb.</hi> lib. 3.</note>.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Livy</hi>'s account of the like Ceremony is ſomething more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; yet differs little in ſubſtance, only that he ſays the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald's concluding Clauſe was, <hi>Otherwiſe may</hi> Jove <hi>ſtrike the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>People as I do this Hog;</hi> and accordingly he kill'd an Hog that ſtood ready by with the Stone which he held in his Hand. This laſt Opinion is confirm'd by the Authority of <hi>Virgil,</hi> when ſpeaking of the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Albanians,</hi> he ſays,

                  <p>THE civil Uſage and extraordinary Favours with which the <hi>Romans</hi> oblig'd the poor conquer'd Nations, has been reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly eſteem'd one of the prime Cauſes of the extent of their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and the eſtabliſhment of their Command: Yet when they ſaw occaſion, they were not to ſeek in ſeverer Methods, ſuch as the ſeizing on the greateſt part of the Enemy's Land, or remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Natives to another Soil. If a State or People had been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to ſurrender themſelves into the <hi>Roman</hi> Power, they us'd <hi>ſub jugum mitti,</hi> to be made paſs under a Yoak in token of Subjection: For this purpoſe, they ſet up two Spears, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a third croſs them at the top, order'd thoſe who had ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd their Perſons to go under them without Arms or Belts.

                  <p>The ſeveral Forms of Government which the <hi>Romans</hi> eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd in their Conqueſts, are very well worth our knowledge, and are ſeldom rightly diſtinguiſh'd. We may take notice of theſe Four: <hi>Colonies, Municipia, Praefecturae,</hi> and <hi>Provinces.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Colonies</hi> (properly ſpeaking) were States, or Communities, where the chief part of the Inhabitants had been tranſplanted from <hi>Rome;</hi> and though mingled with the Natives who had
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:66439:145"/>been left in the conquer'd Place, yet obtain'd the whole Power and Authority in the Adminiſtration of Affairs. One great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of this Inſtitution was, That by this means the Veteran Soldiers, who had ſerv'd out their Legal time, and had ſpent their Vigour in the Honour and Defence of their Country, might be favour'd with a very agreeable Reward, by forming them into a Colony, and ſending them where they might be Maſters of large Poſſeſſions, and ſo lead the remainder of their Days in eaſe and plenty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Municipia,</hi> were properly Corporations, or Infranchiſed Places, where the Natives were allow'd the uſe of their old Laws and Conſtitutions, and at the ſame time honour'd with the Privilege of <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens. But then this Privilege, in ſome of the <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipia,</hi> reach'd no farther than the bare Title, without the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Rights of Citizens; ſuch as voting in the Aſſemblies, bearing Offices in the City, and the like. Of this latter ſort, the firſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample were the <hi>Caerites,</hi> a People of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> who for preſerving the ſacred Relicks of the <hi>Romans,</hi> when the <hi>Gauls</hi> had taken the City, were afterwards dignified with the Name of <hi>Roman</hi> Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens; but not admitted into any part of the Publick Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Hence the <hi>Cenſors</hi> Tables, where they entred the Names of ſuch Perſons as for ſome Miſdemeanour, were to loſe their Right of Suffrage, had the Name of <hi>Caerites Tabulae</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Praefecturae</hi> were certain Towns of <hi>Italy,</hi> whoſe Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants had the Name of <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens; but were neither al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to enjoy their own Laws nor Magiſtrates, being govern'd by annual <hi>Praefects</hi> ſent from <hi>Rome.</hi> Theſe were generally ſuch Places as were either ſuſpected, or had ſome way or other incurr'd the Diſpleaſure of the <hi>Roman</hi> State; this being accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the hardeſt Condition that was impos'd on any People of <hi>Italy</hi>

                  <p>The Provinces were foreign Countries of larger extent, which, upon the entire reducing them under the <hi>Roman</hi> Dominion, were new-modell'd according to the Pleaſure of the Conquerours, and ſubjected to the Command of annual Governours ſent from
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:66439:145"/>
                     <hi>Rome,</hi> being commonly aſſign'd ſuch Taxes and Contributions as the Senate thought fit to demand. But becauſe the ſeveral Towns and Communities in every Country did not behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the ſame manner toward the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſome profeſſing more Friendſhip, and a Deſire of Union and Agreement, while others were more obſtinate and refractary, and unwilling to part with their old Liberty upon any terms; therefore to reward thoſe People who deſerv'd well at their hands, they allow'd ſome Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the uſe of their own Conſtitutions in many reſpects, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times excus'd the Inhabitants from paying Tribute; whence they were term'd <hi>Immunes,</hi> in oppoſition to the <hi>Vectigales.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Tribute exacted from the Provinces, was of two ſorts, either certain or uncertain. The certain Tribute, or <hi>Stipendium,</hi> was either a ſet Summ of Money to be collected by the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial <hi>Quaeſtor,</hi> which they call'd <hi>pecunia ordinaria;</hi> or elſe a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidy rais'd on the Provincials for particular occaſions, ſuch as the maintaining ſo many Soldiers, the rigging out, and paying ſuch a number of Veſſels, and the like, term'd <hi>pecunia extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The uncertain Tribute conſiſted of what they call'd <hi>Portorium, Scriptura,</hi> and <hi>Decuma.</hi> The <hi>Portorium</hi> was a Duty impos'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Goods and Wares, imported and exported.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Scriptura</hi> was a Tax laid upon Paſtures and Cattel.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Decuma</hi> was the quantity of Corn which the Farmers were oblig'd to pay to the <hi>Roman</hi> State, commonly the tenth part of their Crop. But beſides this, which they properly term'd <hi>Frumentum Decumanum,</hi> and which was farm'd by the Publicans, hence call'd <hi>Decumani,</hi> there was the <hi>Frumentum emptum,</hi> and the <hi>frumentum aeſtimatum,</hi> both taken up in the Provinces. The <hi>Frumentum emptum</hi> was of two ſorts, either <hi>decumanum,</hi> or <hi>imperatum;</hi> the former was another Tenth paid upon the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of ſuch a Summ, as the Senate had determin'd to be the price of it, who rated it ſo much a Buſhel at their pleaſure. The <hi>Frumentum imperatum,</hi> was a quantity of Corn equally exacted of the Provincial Farmers after the two Tenths, at ſuch a price as the chief Magiſtrate pleas'd to give. <hi>Frumentum aeſtimatum,</hi> was a Corn-Tax requir'd by the Chief Magiſtrate of the Province for his private Uſe, and the Occaſions of his Family. This was commonly compounded for in Money, and on that account took its Name <hi>ab aeſtimando,</hi> from rating it at ſuch a Summ of Money.</p>
                  <p>Beſides all theſe, <hi>Sigonius</hi> mentions <hi>Frumentum honorarium</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Authority of <hi>Cicero,</hi> in his Oration againſt <hi>Piſo:</hi> But
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:66439:146"/>perhaps <hi>Cicero</hi> in that place does not reſtrain the <hi>Honorarium</hi> to Corn, but may mean, in general, the Preſent uſually made to the Provincial Governours, ſoon after their entrance on their Office.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XIX.</hi> The <hi>Roman</hi> Way of Taking Towns; with the moſt remarkable Inventions and Engines made uſe of in their Sieges.</head>
                  <p>BEFORE we enquire into this Subject, a very memorable Cuſtom preſents it ſelf to our notice, which was always practis'd as ſoon as the <hi>Roman</hi> Army inveſted any Town; and that was the <hi>evocatio Deorum tutelarium,</hi> or the enviting out the Guardian Deities: The reaſon of which ſeems to have been, either becauſe they thought it impoſſible to force any Place, while it enjoy'd ſuch powerful Defenders; or elſe, becauſe they accounted it a moſt heinous act of Impiety, to act in Hoſtility againſt the Perſons of the Gods. This Cuſtom is deſcrib'd at large by <hi>Macrobius,</hi> in his <hi>Saturnalia,</hi> lib. 3. cap. 9.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> were ſeldom deſirous of attempting any Town by way of Siege, becauſe they thought it would ſcarce anſwer the Expence and Incommodity of the Method; ſo that this was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally their laſt Hopes; and in all their great Wars, there are very few Examples of any long Leagures undertook by them. The means by which they poſſeſs'd themſelves of any important Places, were commonly either by Storm or Surrendry. If they took a Town by Storm, it was either by open force, or by ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem. In the former they made their Attacks without battering the Wall, and were only ſaid <hi>aggredi <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbem cum coronâ, to begirt a Town;</hi> becauſe they drew their whole Army round the Walls, and fell on in all Quarters at once. If this Way was ineffectual,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:66439:146"/>they batter'd down the Walls with their Rams and other En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines. Sometimes they min'd, and entred the Town under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground: Sometimes, that they might engage with the Enemy upon equal terms, they built wooden Towers, or rais'd Mounts to the heighth of the Walls, from whence they might gall and moleſt them within their Works. The Beſieged were in moſt danger in the firſt caſe, upon a general Aſſault; for their Walls were to be made good in all places at once; and it fell out many times, that there were not Men enough to ſupply and relieve all the Parts; and if they had a ſufficient num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Men, yet perhaps all were not of an equal Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; and if any gave ground, the whole Town was in great hazard of being loſt: So that the <hi>Romans</hi> oftentimes carried very conſiderable Places at one Storm. But if they batter'd the Walls with Engines, they were under ſome diſadvantage, their Quarters being of neceſſity to be extended; ſo that they muſt be thinner and weaker in ſome places than in others, and unable to make a ſtout oppoſition againſt any conſiderable Sally. Beſides, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged were not at a loſs for ways of defeating their Stratagems; as, they eluded the Force of their Mines by Countermining, or by diſturbing them in their Works; particularly putting Oil and Feathers, with other ſtinking Stuff, into Barrels of Wood, and then ſetting them on fire, they tumbled them among the <hi>Romans,</hi> that the noiſomneſs of the Stench might force them to quit their Stations. Their Towers of Wood, their Rams and other Engines, they commonly ſet on fire, and deſtroy'd, and then for the Mounts which were rais'd againſt the Walls, they us'd, by dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing underneath, to ſteal away the Earth, and looſen the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Mount till it fell to the ground.</p>
                  <p>Upon this account the <hi>Romans</hi> (as was before obſerv'd) much preferr'd the ſudden and brisk way of attacking a Place; and if they did not carry it in a very little time, they frequently rais'd the Siege, and proſecuted the War by other means. As <hi>Scipio,</hi> in his <hi>African</hi> Expedition, having aſſaulted <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tica</hi> without ſucceſs, he chang'd his Reſolution, drew off his Men from the Place, and addreſs'd himſelf wholly to bring the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Army to an Engagement: And therefore, though ſometimes they continu'd a tedious Siege, as at <hi>Veii, Carthage,</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> yet gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally they were much more deſirous of drawing the Enemy to a Battel; for by defeating an Army, they many times got a whole Kingdom in a day; whereas an obſtinate Town has coſt them ſeveral Years.</p>

                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:66439:147"/>
                  <p>The Inventions and Engines which the <hi>Romans</hi> made uſe of in their Sieges were very numerous, and the Knowledge of them is but of little Service at preſent; however we may take a ſhort view of the moſt conſiderable of them, and which moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently occur in <hi>Caeſar</hi> and other Hiſtorians: Theſe are the <hi>Turres mobiles,</hi> the <hi>Teſtudines,</hi> the <hi>Muſculus,</hi> the <hi>Vineae,</hi> and the <hi>Plutei,</hi> together with the <hi>Aries,</hi> the <hi>Baliſta,</hi> the <hi>Catapulta,</hi> and the <hi>Scorpio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Turres mobiles,</hi> or moveable Turrets, were of two ſorts, the leſſer and the greater: The leſſer ſort were about ſixty Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits high, and the ſquare ſides ſeventeen Cubits broad; they had five or ſix, and ſometimes ten Stories or Diviſions, every Diviſion being made open on all ſides. The greater Turret was 120 Cubits high, 23 Cubits ſquare; containing ſometimes fifteen, ſometimes twenty Diviſions. They were of very great uſe in making approaches to the Walls, the Diviſions being able to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Soldiers with Engines, Ladders, Caſting Bridges, and other Neceſſaries. The Wheels on which they went were contriv'd to be within the Planks, to defend them from the Enemy, and the Men who were to drive them forward ſtood behind, where they were moſt ſecure; the Soldiers in the inſide were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by raw Hides which were thrown over the Turret, in ſuch places as were moſt expos'd.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Teſtudo</hi> was properly a Figure which the Soldiers caſt themſelves into; ſo that their Targets ſhould cloſe all together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove their Heads, and defend them from the miſſive Weapons of the Enemy; as if we ſuppoſe the firſt rank to have ſtood upright on their Feet, and the reſt to have ſtoop'd lower and lower by degrees 'till the laſt Rank kneel'd down on their Knees; ſo that every Rank covering with their Target the Heads of all in the Rank before them, they repreſented a Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toiſe-ſhell, or a ſort of Pent-houſe. This was us'd as well in Field Battels as in Sieges. But beſides this, the <hi>Romans</hi> call'd in general all their cover'd defenſive Engines, <hi>Teſtudines:</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which, thoſe which moſt properly obtain'd the Name, ſeem'd to have been almoſt of an oval Figure compos'd of Boards, and wattled up at the ſides with Wicker; ſerving for the conveyance of the Soldiers near the Walls, on ſeveral occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; they run upon Wheels, and ſo were diſtinguiſh'd from the <hi>Vineae,</hi> with which they are ſometimes confounded.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Muſculus</hi> is conceiv'd to have been much of the ſame nature as the <hi>Teſtudines;</hi> but it ſeems to have been of a ſmall ſize, and compos'd of ſtronger Materials, being expos'd a much
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:66439:147"/>longer time to the force of the Enemy; for in theſe <hi>Muſculi</hi> the Pioneers were ſent to the very Walls, where they were to continue, while with their <hi>Dolabrae,</hi> or Pick-Axes, and other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, they endeavour'd to undermine the Foundations. <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> has deſcrib'd the <hi>Muſculus</hi> at large in his ſecond Book of the Civil Wars.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Vineae</hi> were compos'd of Wicker Hurdles laid for a Roof on the top of Poſts, which the Soldiers, who went under it for Shelter, bore up with their Hands. Some will have them to have been contriv'd with a double Roof; the firſt and lower Roof of Planks, and the upper Roof of Hurdles to break the force of any Blow without diſordering the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Plutei</hi> conſiſted of the ſame Materials as the former, but were of a much different Figure, being ſhap'd like an arched ſort of Waggon; and having three Wheels, ſo conveniently pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that the Machine would move either way with equal caſe. They were put much to the ſame Uſes as the <hi>Muſculi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Engines hitherto deſcrib'd were primarily intended for the defence of the Soldiers; the Offenſive are yet behind. Of theſe the moſt celebrated, and which only deſerves a particular Deſcription, was the <hi>Aries</hi> or Ram: This was of two ſorts, the one rude and plain, the other artificial and compound. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſeems to have been no more than a great Beam which the Soldiers bore on their Arms and Shoulders, and with one end of it by main force aſſail'd the Wall. The compound Ram is thus deſcrib'd by <hi>Joſephus:</hi> 
                     <q>The Ram (ſaith he) is a vaſt long Beam, like the Maſt of a Ship, ſtrengthen'd at one end with a Head of Iron, ſomething reſembling that of a Ram, whence it took its Name. This is hang'd by the midſt with Ropes to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Beam, which lies croſs a couple of Poſts, and hanging thus equally balanc'd, it is by a great number of Men violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thruſt forward, and recoil'd backward, and ſo ſhakes the Wall with its Iron Head. Nor is there any Tower or Wall ſo thick or ſtrong, that after the firſt Aſſault of the Ram, can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards reſiſt its force in the repeated Aſſaults<note n="(a)" place="bottom">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Plutarch</hi> informs us that <hi>Mark Antony</hi> in the <hi>Parthian</hi> War made uſe of a Ram fourſcore Foot long: And <hi>Vitruvius</hi> tells us, That they were ſometimes 106, ſometimes 120 Foot in length; and to this perhaps the force and ſtrength of the Engine was in a great meaſure owing. The Ram was manag'd at one
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:66439:148"/>time by a whole Century or Order of Soldiers; and they being ſpent were ſeconded by another Century; ſo that it play'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually without any intermiſſion, being uſually cover'd with a <hi>Vinea,</hi> to protect it from the Attempts of the Enemy.</p>
                  <p>As for the other Engines which ſerved not for ſuch great uſes, and are not ſo celebrated in Authors, a mechanical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of them would be vexatious as well as needleſs: On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it may in ſhort be obſerv'd, That the <hi>Baliſta</hi> was always employ'd in throwing great Stones, the <hi>Catapulta</hi> in caſting the larger ſort of Darts and Spears, and the <hi>Scorpio</hi> in ſending the leſſer Darts and Arrows.</p>

                  <p>THE <hi>Romans,</hi> tho' their City was ſeated very conveniently for Maritime Affairs, not being above fifteen Miles diſtant from the <hi>Tyrrhenian</hi> Sea; and having the River <hi>Tyber</hi> running through it, capable of receiving the ſmaller Veſſels, yet ſeem to have wholly neglected all Naval Concerns for many Years after the building of <hi>Rome.</hi> And ſome are willing to aſſign this as one of the main Cauſes which preſerv'd that State ſo long in its pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Innocence and Integrity; free from all thoſe Corruptions which an intercourſe with Foreigners might probably have brought into faſhion. However <hi>Dionyſius</hi> aſſures us, that <hi>Ancus Martius</hi> built <hi>Oſtia</hi> at the Mouth of the <hi>Tyber</hi> for a Port, that the City might by this means be ſupplied with the Commodities of the neighbouring Nations<note n="(a)" place="bottom">

And it appears from the Reaſons of the <hi>Tarentine</hi> War agreed upon by all Hiſtorians, that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> in that Age had a Fleet at Sea. Yet <hi>Polybius</hi> expreſly maintains, that the firſt time they ever adventur'd to Sea was in the firſt <hi>Punick</hi> War<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Lib. 1.</note>; but he muſt either mean this only of Ships of War, or elſe contradict himſelf: For in another part of his Works, giving us a Tranſcript of ſome Articles agreed on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Romans</hi> and the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in the Conſulſhip of <hi>M.

So wonderful was the Bravery and Reſolution of that People in Enterprizes of the greateſt hazard and moment; that having hitherto ſcarce dream'd of Navigation, they ſhould at one heat reſolve on ſo adventurous an Expedition, and make the firſt proof of their Skill in a Naval Battle with the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> who had held the Dominion of the Sea unconteſted, deriv'd down to them from their Anceſtors. Nay, ſo utterly ignorant were the <hi>Romans</hi> in the Art of Ship-building, that it would have been almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for them to have put their deſign in effect, had not F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

                     </gap>he, who always eſpous'd their Cauſe, by a meer Accident inſtructed them in the method. For a <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Galley, which was out a cruiſing, venturing too near the Shoar, chanc'd to be ſtranded; and before they could get her off, the <hi>Romans</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepting them, took her; and by the Model of this Galley they built their firſt Fleet. But their way of inſtructing their Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the uſe of the Oar is no leſs remarkable, wherein they proceeded after this manner: They caus'd Banks to be contriv'd on the Shore in the ſame faſhion and Order as they were to be in their Galleys, and placing their Men with their Oars upon the Banks, there they exercis'd them: An Officer for that purpoſe being ſeated in the midſt, who by Signs with his Hand inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted them how at once and all together they were to dip their Oars, and how in like manner to recover them out of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: And by this means they became acquainted with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the Oar. But in a little time, finding their Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels were not built with extraordinary Art, and conſequently prov'd ſomewhat unweildy in working, it came into their Heads to recompence this Defect, by contriving ſome new In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, which might be of uſe to them in Fight. And then it was that they devis'd the famous Machine call'd the <hi>Corvus;</hi> which
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:66439:149"/>was fram'd after the following manner: They erected on the Prow of their Veſſels, a round piece of Timber, of about a Foot and an half diameter, and about twelve Foot long; on the top whereof they had a Block or Pully: round this piece of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber they laid a Stage or Platform of Boards, four Foot broad, and about eighteen Foot long, which was well fram'd, and faſten'd with Iron. The entrance was long-ways, and it mov'd about the aforeſaid upright piece of Timber, as on a Spindle, and could be hoiſted up within ſix Foot of the top: about this was a ſort of a Parapet, Knee high, which was defended with upright Bars of Iron, ſharpen'd at the ends; toward the top whereof there was a Ring; through this Ring, faſtening a Rope, by the help of the Pully, they hoiſted or lowred the Engine at pleaſure; and ſo with it attack'd the Enemies Veſſels, ſometimes on their Bow, and ſometimes on their Broad-ſide, as occaſion beſt ſerv'd. When they had grapled the Enemy with thoſe Iron Spikes, if they happen'd to ſwing Broad-ſide to Broad-ſide, then they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd from all parts; but in caſe they attack'd them on the Bow, they enter'd two and two by the help of this Machine, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt defending the fore-part, and thoſe that follow'd the Flanks, keeping the Boſs of their Bucklers level with the top of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e Parapet.</p>
                  <p>To this purpoſe <hi>Polybius</hi> (according to the late moſt excellent Verſion) gives us an account of the firſt Warlike Preparations, which the <hi>Romans</hi> made by Sea. We may add, in ſhort, the Order which they obſerv'd in drawing up their Fleet for Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; taken from the ſame Author. The two Conſuls were in the two Admiral Galleys in the Front of their two diſtinct Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons, each of them juſt a-head of their own Diviſions, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaſt of each other; the firſt Fleet being poſted on the Right, the ſecond on the Left, making two long Files or Lines of Battle. And whereas it was neceſſary to give a due ſpace between each Galley, to ply their Oars, and keep clear one of another, and to have their Heads or Prows looking ſomewhat outwards; this manner of drawing up did therefore naturally form an Angle, the point whereof was at the two Admiral-Galleys, which were near together; and as their two Lines were prolong'd, ſo the diſtance grew conſequently wider and wider towards the Rear. But becauſe the Naval as well as the Land Army conſiſted of four Legions, and accordingly the Ships made four Diviſions, two of theſe are yet behind: Of which the third Fleet, or the third Legion, was drawn up Front-ways in the Rear of the firſt and ſecond, and ſo ſtretching along from point to point compos'd a
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:66439:149"/>Triangle, whereof the third Line was the Baſe. Their Veſſels of Burden, that carried their Horſes and Baggage, were in the Rear of theſe; and were by the help of ſmall Boats provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for that purpoſe, towed or drawn after them. In the Rear of all was the fourth Fleet, call'd the <hi>Triarians,</hi> drawn up like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in Rank or Front-ways, parallel to the third: but theſe made a longer Line, by which means the Extremities ſtretch'd out, and extended beyond the two Angles at the Baſe. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Diviſions of the Army being thus diſpos'd, form'd, as is ſaid, a Triangle; The Area within was void, but the Baſe was thick and ſolid, and the whole Body quick, active, and very difficult to be broken.</p>
                  <p>If we deſcend to a particular Deſcription of the ſeveral ſorts of Ships; we meet commonly with three kinds, Ships of War, Ships of Burden, and Ships of Paſſage: The firſt for the moſt part rowed with Oars; the ſecond ſteer'd with Sails; and the laſt often towed with Ropes. Ships of Paſſage were either for the Tranſportation of Men, ſuch as the <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>A Great part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Pomp and Superſtition was taken up in their Games and Shows, and therefore very many of their Cuſtoms have a dependance on thoſe Solemnities. But in our way we ſhould not paſs by the private Sports and Diverſions; not that they are worth our notice in themſelves, but becauſe many Paſſages and Alluſions in Authors would otherwiſe be very difficult to apprehend.</p>
                  <p>The Private Games particularly worth our Remark are, the <hi>Latrunculi,</hi> the <hi>Tali</hi> and <hi>Teſſerae,</hi> the <hi>Pila,</hi> the <hi>Par impar,</hi> and the <hi>Trochus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Game at <hi>Latrunculi</hi> ſeems to have been much of the ſame nature as the Modern Cheſs: The Original of it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally referr'd to <hi>Palamedes</hi> his Invention at the Siege of <hi>Troy:</hi> Tho' <hi>Seneca</hi> attributes it to <hi>Chilon,</hi> one of the ſeven <hi>Grecian</hi> Sages; and ſome fanſie that <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> King of <hi>Epirus</hi> contriv'd this Sport, to inſtruct his Soldiers, after a diverting manner, in the Military Art. However, 'tis certain, it expreſſes the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:66439:152"/>Chance and Order of War ſo very happily, that no place can lay ſo juſt a Claim to the Invention as the Camp. Thus the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious <hi>Vida</hi> begins his Poem on this Subject.</p>

                     <hi>Seneca</hi> has mention'd this Play oftner perhaps than any other <hi>Roman</hi> Author; particularly in one place he has a very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Story, in which he deſigns to give us an Example of wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Reſolution and Contempt of death; tho' ſome will be more apt to interpret it as on inſtance of inſenſible Stupidity. The Story is this: One <hi>Canius Julius</hi> (whom he extols very much on other Accounts) had been ſentenc'd to death by <hi>Caligula;</hi> the Centurion coming by with the Tribe of Malefactors, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering him to bear them company to execution, happen'd to find him engag'd at this Game. <hi>Canius</hi> upon his firſt Summons pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently fell to counting his Men, and bidding his Antagoniſt be ſure not to brag falſly of the Victory after his death, he only deſir'd the Centurion to bear witneſs, that he had one Man upon the Board more than his Companion; and ſo very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily join'd himſelf to the poor Wretches that were going to ſuffer<note n="(a)" place="bottom">

                  <p>But the largeſt and moſt accurate Account of the <hi>Latrunculi</hi> given us by the Ancients, is to be met with in the Poem to <hi>Piſo;</hi> which ſome will have to be <hi>Ovid</hi>'s, others <hi>Lucan</hi>'s, and many the Work of an unknown Author.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Tali</hi> and the <hi>Teſſerae,</hi> by reaſon of ſo many Paſſages in Authors equally applicable to both, have often times been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with one another, and by ſome diſtinguiſh'd as a ſeparate Game from the <hi>luſus aleae,</hi> or Dice: Whereas, properly ſpeaking, the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> had two ſorts of Games at Dice, the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus talorum,</hi> or play at Cockall, and the <hi>Ludus teſſerarum,</hi> or what we call Dice. They play'd at the firſt with four <hi>Tali,</hi> and at the other with three <hi>Teſſerae.</hi> The <hi>Tali</hi> had but four ſides, mark'd with four oppoſite numbers; one ſide with a <hi>Tres,</hi> and the oppoſite with a <hi>Quatre;</hi> one with an Ace, and the contrary with a Sice. The Dice had ſix Faces, four mark'd with the ſame Numbers as the <hi>Tali,</hi> and the two others with a <hi>Deux</hi> and a <hi>Cinque,</hi> always one againſt the other; ſo that in both Plays the upper Number and the lower, either on the <hi>Talus</hi> or <hi>Teſſera,</hi> conſtantly made ſeven.</p>
                  <p>There were very ſevere Laws in force againſt theſe Plays, forbidding the uſe of them at all Seaſons, only during the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnalia;</hi> tho' they gam'd ordinarily at other times, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Prohibition. But there was one uſe made of them at Feaſts and Entertainments, which perhaps did not fall under the extent of the Laws; and that was to throw Dice who ſhould command in chief, and have the power of preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing Rules at a Drinking Bout; whom <hi>Horace</hi> calls <hi>Arbiter bibendi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They threw both the <hi>Tali</hi> and the <hi>Teſſerae</hi> out of a long Box; for which they had ſeveral Names, as <hi>Fritillum, Pyrgus, Turricu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, Orca,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>There are many odd Terms ſcatter'd up and down in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, by which they ſignified their fortunate and unfortunate Caſts, we may take notice of the beſt and the worſt. The beſt Caſt with the <hi>Tali,</hi> was when there came up four different Numbers, as <hi>Tres, Quatre, Sice, Ace:</hi> The beſt with the Dice was three <hi>Sices;</hi> the common Term for both, was <hi>Venus,</hi> or <hi>Baſilicus;</hi> the pooreſt caſt in both having the Name of <hi>Canis. Perſius</hi> oppoſeth the <hi>Senio</hi> and the <hi>Canicula</hi> as the beſt and worſt Chances.</p>

                  <p>Some Creatures were preſented meerly as ſtrange Sights and Rarities, as the Crocodiles, and ſeveral outlandiſh Birds and Beaſts; others for the Combat, as Lyons, Tygers, Leopards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> other Creatures, either purely for delight, or elſe for the uſe of the People, at ſuch times as they were allow'd the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of catching what they could for themſelves; as Hares, Deer, and the like. We may reckon up three ſorts of Diverſions with the Beaſts, which all went under the common Name of <hi>Vena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio;</hi> the firſt when the People were permitted to run after the Beaſts, and catch what they could for their own uſe; the ſecond when the Beaſts fought with one another; and the laſt when they were brought out to engage with Men.</p>
                  <p>When the People were allow'd to lay hold on what they could get, and carry off for their own uſe, they call'd it <hi>Venatio di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reptionis:</hi> This ſeems to have been an Inſtitution of the later Emperours. It was many times preſented with extraordinary Charge, and great variety of contrivances: The middle part of the <hi>Circo</hi> being ſet all over with Trees, remov'd thither by main force, and faſten'd to huge Planks, which were laid on the Ground; theſe being cover'd with Earth and Turf, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented a natural Foreſt; into which the Beaſts being let from the <hi>Caveae,</hi> or Dens under ground, the People, at a Sign given by the Emperour, fell to hunting them, and carry'd away what they kill'd to regale upon at home. The Beaſts uſually given, were Boars, Deer, Oxen, and Sheep. Sometimes all kinds of Birds were preſented after the ſame manner.</p>
                  <p>The Fights between Beaſts were exhibited with great Varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; ſometimes we find a Tyger match'd with a Lyon; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a Lyon with a Bull; a Bull with an Elephant, a Rhino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceros with a Bear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sometimes we meet with Deer hunted on the <hi>Arena</hi> by a pack of Dogs. But the moſt wonderful Sight was, when by bringing the Water into the Amphitheatre, huge Sea-Monſters were introduc'd to combat with wild Beaſts.</p>

                  <p>Thoſe who cop'd on plain Ground with the Beaſts commonly met with a very unequal Match; and therefore, for the moſt part, their ſafety conſiſted in the nimble turning of their Body, and leaping up and down to delude the force of their Adverſary.

                  <p>But becauſe this way of engaging commonly prov'd ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Beaſts, they had other ways of dealing with them; as by aſſailing them with Darts, Spears, and other miſſive Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, from the higher parts of the Amphitheatre, where they were ſecure from their reach; ſo as by ſome means or other they commonly contriv'd to diſpatch three or four hundred Beaſts in one Show.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>NA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>MACHIAE</hi> owe their Original to the time of the firſt <hi>Punick</hi> War, when the <hi>Romans</hi> firſt initiated their Men in the knowledge of Sea Affairs. After the improvement of many Years they were deſign'd as well for the gratifying the Sight, as for encreaſing their Naval Experience and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; and therefore compos'd one of the ſolemn Shows, by
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:66439:162"/>which the Magiſtrates or Emperours, or any Affecters of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity ſo often made their Court to the People.</p>
                  <p>The uſual Accounts we have of theſe Exerciſes ſeem to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them as nothing elſe but the Image of a Naval Fight.

                  <p>THE firſt riſe of the <hi>Gladiators</hi> is referr'd to the ancient Cuſtom of killing Perſons at the Funerals of great Men. For the old Heathens fanſying the Ghoſts of the deceas'd to be ſatisfied, and rendred propitious by Human Blood, at firſt they us'd to buy Captives, or untoward Slaves, and offer'd them at the Obſequies. Afterwards they contriv'd to veil over their impious Barbarity with the ſpecious Show of Pleaſure, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Combat; and therefore training up ſuch Perſons as they had procur'd in ſome tolerable knowledge of Weapons, upon the Day appointed for the Sacrifices to the departed Ghoſts, they oblig'd them to maintain a mortal Encounter at the Tombs of their Friends.

Nay, the very Prieſts were ſometimes the Exhibitors of ſuch impious Pomps; for we meet with the <hi>Ludi Pontificales</hi> in <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius</hi>

Yet the Freemen ſoon put in for a ſhare of this Privilege to be kill'd in Jeſt; and accordingly many times of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd themſelves to hire for the Amphitheatre; whence they had the Name of <hi>Auctorati.</hi> Nay, the Knights and Noblemen, and even the Senators themſelves at laſt were not aſham'd to take up the ſame Profeſſion; ſome to keep themſelves from ſtarving, after they had ſquander'd away their Eſtates; and others to curry favour with the Emperours: So that <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was forc'd to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand by a publick Edict, that none of the Senatorian Order ſhould turn <hi>Gladiators</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Retiarius</hi> was dreſs'd in a ſhort Coat, having a <hi>Tuſcina</hi> or Trident in his Left Hand, and a Net in his Right; with which he endeavour'd to entangle his Adverſary; and then
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:66439:165"/>with his Trident might eaſily diſpatch him. On his Head he wore only a Hat tied under his Chin with a broad Ribbon. The <hi>Secutor</hi> was arm'd with a Buckler, and a Helmet, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was the Picture of a Fiſh, in alluſion to the Net. His Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon was a Scymetar, or <hi>Falx ſupina.</hi> He was call'd <hi>Secutor,</hi> becauſe if the <hi>Retiarius,</hi> againſt whom he was always match'd, ſhould happen to fail in caſting his Net, his only ſafety lay in flight; ſo that in this caſe he ply'd his Heels as faſt he could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the place of Combat, 'till he had got his Net in order for a ſecond throw: In the mean time this <hi>Secutor,</hi> or Follower, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu'd him, and endeavour'd to prevent his deſign. <hi>Juvenal</hi> is very happy in the Account he gives us of a young Nobleman that ſcandalouſly turn'd <hi>Retiarius</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Nero:</hi> Nor is there any relation of this ſort of Combat ſo exact in any other Author.</p>

This they call'd <hi>Munus pronunciare,</hi> or <hi>proponere;</hi> and the <hi>Libelli,</hi> or Bills, were ſometimes term'd <hi>Edicta.</hi> Many times, beſides theſe Bills, they ſet up great Pictures, on which were deſcrib'd the manner of the Fight, and the Effigies of ſome of the moſt ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated <hi>Gladiators,</hi> whom they intended to bring out.

                  </head>
                  <p>THE <hi>L<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>DISCENICI,</hi> or Stage-Plays, have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly divided into four Species, Satire, Mimick, Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and Comedy. The elder <hi>Scaliger</hi> will have Satire to have proceeded from Tragedy, in the ſame manner as the <hi>Mimus</hi> from Comedy: But we are aſſur'd this was in uſe at <hi>Rome</hi> long before the more perfect Drama's had gain'd a place on the Stage. Nor has the ſame excellent Critick been more happy in tracing the Original of this ſort of Poetry as far as <hi>Greece:</hi> For we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſuppoſe it to bear any reſemblance to the <hi>Chorus</hi> or Dance of <hi>Satyrs,</hi> which us'd to appear in the Theatres at <hi>Athens,</hi> as an Appendage to ſome of their Tragedies, thence call'd Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrique. This kind of <hi>Greek</hi> Farce was taken up purely in the Characters of Mirth and Wantonneſs, not admitting thoſe Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtical Reflections, which were the very Eſſence of the <hi>Roman</hi> Satire. Therefore <hi>Caſaubon</hi> and <hi>Dacier,</hi> without caſting an Eye toward <hi>Greece,</hi> make no queſtion but the Name is to be deriv'd from <hi>Satura,</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Word, ſignifying <hi>full:</hi> The <hi>(u)</hi> being chang'd into an <hi>(i),</hi> after the ſame manner as <hi>optumus</hi> and <hi>maxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> were afterwards ſpell'd <hi>optimus</hi> and <hi>Maximus. Satura</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Adjective, muſt be ſuppos'd to relate to the Subſtantive <hi>Lanx,</hi> a Platter or Charger; ſuch as they fill'd yearly with all ſorts of Fruit, and offer'd to the Gods at their Feſtivals, as the <hi>Primitiae,</hi> or firſt Gatherings of the Seaſon. Such an Expreſſion might be well applied to this kind of Poem, which was full of various matter, and written on different Subjects. Nor are there wanting other inſtances of the ſame way of ſpeaking; as particularly <hi>per Saturam ſententias exquirere</hi> is us'd by <hi>Saluſt,</hi> to ſignifie the way of voting in the Senate, when neither the Members were told, nor the Voices counted, but all gave their

                  </p>
                  <p>During the ſpace of almoſt four hundred Years from the building of the City, the <hi>Romans</hi> had never known any Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments of the Stage: Chance and Jollity firſt found out thoſe Verſes, which they call'd <hi>Saturnian,</hi> becauſe they ſuppos'd ſuch to have been in uſe under <hi>Saturn;</hi> and <hi>Feſcennine</hi> from <hi>Feſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> a Town in <hi>Tuſcany</hi> where they were firſt practis'd. The Actors, upon occaſions of Merriment, with a groſs and ruſtick kind of Raillery, reproach'd one another <hi>ex tempore</hi> with their failings; and at the ſame time were nothing ſparing of it to the Audience. Somewhat of this Cuſtom was afterwards retain'd in their <hi>Saturnalia,</hi> or Feaſt of <hi>Saturn,</hi> celebrated in <hi>December:</hi> At leaſt all kind of freedom of Speech was then allow'd to Slaves, even againſt their Maſters: And we are not without ſome Imitation of it in our <hi>Chriſtmas Gambols.</hi> We can't have a better Notion of this rude and unpoliſh'd kind of Farce, than by imagining a Company of Clowns on a Holyday dancing lub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, and upbraiding one another in <hi>ex tempore</hi> Doggrel with their Defects and Vices; and the Stories that were told of them in Bake-houſes and Barbers Shops.</p>
                  <p>This rough-caſt unhewn Poetry was inſtead of Stage-Plays for the ſpace of an hundred and twenty Years together: But then, when they began to be ſomewhat better bred, and entred, as one may ſay, into the firſt Rudiments of Civil Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, they left theſe Hedge-notes for another ſort of Poem, a little more poliſh'd, which was alſo full of pleaſant Raillery, but without any mixture of Obſcenity. This new Species of Poetry appear'd under the Name of Satire, becauſe of its va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, and was adorn'd with Compoſitions of Muſick, and with Dances.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Livius Andronicus,</hi> about the Year of <hi>Rome</hi> 514, had introduc'd the new Entertainments of Tragedy and Comedy, the People neglected and abandon'd their old Diverſion of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires: But not long after they took them up again, and then they join'd them to their Comedies, playing them at the end of the <hi>Drama;</hi> as the <hi>French</hi> continue at this Day to act their
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:66439:170"/>Farces in the nature of a ſeparate Repreſentation from their Tragedies.</p>
                  <p>A Year after <hi>Andronicus</hi> had open'd the <hi>Roman</hi> Stage with his new Drama's, <hi>Ennius</hi> was born; who when he was grown to Man's Eſtate, having ſeriouſly conſider'd the Genius of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and how eagerly they follow'd the firſt Satires, thought it would be worth his while, to refine upon the Project, and to write Satires not to be acted on the Theatre, but read. The Event was anſwerable to his Expectation, and his Deſign being improv'd by <hi>Pacuvius,</hi> adorn'd with a more graceful turn by <hi>Lucilius,</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd to its full height by <hi>Horace, Juvenal,</hi> and <hi>Perſius,</hi> grew into a diſtinct Species of Poetry, and has ever met with kind Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception in the World. To the ſame Original we owe the other ſort of Satire, call'd <hi>Varronian</hi> (from the learned <hi>Varro</hi> who firſt compos'd it. This was written freely, without any reſtraint to Verſe or Proſe, but conſiſting of an intermixture of both: Of which nature are the <hi>Satyricon</hi> of <hi>Petronius, Seneca</hi>'s mock Deifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Emperour <hi>Claudius,</hi> and <hi>Boethius</hi> his Conſolation.</p>

They were not maſqu'd, but had their Faces ſmear'd over with Soot, and dreſs'd themſelves in Lamb-skins, which are call'd <hi>peſcia</hi> in the old Verſes of the <hi>Salii.</hi> They wore Garlands of Ivy, and carried Baskets full of Herbs and Flowers to the Honour of <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> as had been obſerv'd in the firſt Inſtitution of the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom at <hi>Athens.</hi> They acted always bare-foot, and were thence call'd <hi>Planipedes.</hi>

                  <p>Theſe Diverſions being receiv'd with univerſal Applauſe by the People, the Actors took aſſurance to model them into a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Entertainment from the other Plays, and preſent them by themſelves. And perhaps it was not 'till now that they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to write ſeparate pieces of Poetry with the Name of <hi>Mimi,</hi> repreſenting an imperfect ſort of <hi>Drama,</hi> not divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Acts, and perform'd only by a ſingle Perſon.

                  <p>THE <hi>Roman</hi> Tragedy and Comedy were wholly borrow'd from the <hi>Graecians,</hi> and therefore do not ſo properly fall under the preſent Deſign: Yet in order to a right underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe Pieces, there is ſcope enough for a very uſeful En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry without roaming ſo far as <hi>Athens,</hi> unleſs upon a neceſſary account. The Parts of a Play agreed on by ancient and modern Writers are theſe four: Firſt, the <hi>Protaſis,</hi> or Entrance, which gives a light only to the Characters of the Perſons, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds very little to any part of the Action. Secondly, the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſis</hi> or working up of the Plot, where the Play grows warmer; the Deſign or Action of it is drawing on, and you ſee ſomething promiſing that it will come to paſs. Thirdly, the <hi>Cataſtaſis,</hi> or, in a <hi>Roman</hi> Word, the <hi>Status,</hi> the height and full growth of the Play: This may properly be call'd the Counter-turn, which deſtroys that Expectation, imbroils the Action in new Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and leaves us far diſtant from that Hope in which it found us. Laſtly, the <hi>Cataſtrophe,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the diſcovery or unravelling of the Plot: Here we ſee all things ſettling again on their firſt Foundations; and the Obſtacles which hindred the Deſign or Action of the Play once remov'd, it ends with
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:66439:171" rendition="simple:additions"/>that reſemblance of Truth and Nature, that the Audience are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the Conduct of it<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s Dramat.

It's a queſtion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether the firſt <hi>Roman Drama's</hi> were divided into Acts; or at leaſt it ſeems probable, that theſe were not admitted into Comedy 'till after it had loſt its <hi>Chorus,</hi> and ſo ſtood in need of ſome more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Diviſions than could be made by the Muſick only. Yet the five Acts were ſo eſtabliſh'd in the time of <hi>Horace,</hi> that he gives it for a Rule,</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Drama's</hi> preſented at <hi>Rome,</hi> were divided in general into <hi>Palliatae</hi> and <hi>Togatae, Graecian,</hi> and properly <hi>Roman:</hi> In the former, the Plot being laid in <hi>Greece,</hi> the Actors were habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted according to the faſhion of that Country; in the other the Perſons were ſuppos'd to be <hi>Romans.</hi> But then the Comedies properly <hi>Roman</hi> were of ſeveral ſorts; <hi>Praetextatae,</hi> when the Actors were ſuppos'd to be Perſons of Quality, ſuch as had the liberty of wearing the <hi>Praetexta,</hi> or Purple Gown: <hi>Tabernarae,</hi> when the <hi>Tabernae,</hi> low ordinary Buildings were expreſs'd in the Scenes, the Perſons being of the lower Rank. <hi>Suetonius</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Socci</hi> were a ſlight kind of covering for the Feet, whence the Faſhion and the Name of our Socks are deriv'd.

                  <p>Another Reaſon why they were taken up by the Actors of Comedy might be, becauſe they were the fitteſt that can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd for dancing. Thus <hi>Catullus</hi> invokes <hi>Hymen</hi> the Patron of Weddings.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Perſona,</hi> or Maſque <hi>Agellius</hi> derives (according to an old Author) from <hi>Perſono,</hi> to ſound throughly; becauſe theſe Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards being put over the Face, and left open at the Mouth, rendred the Voice much clearer and fuller, by contracting it into a leſſer compaſs. But <hi>Scaliger</hi> will not allow of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture. However, the reaſon of it (which is all that concerns us at preſent) appears from all the old Figures of the Maſques, in which we find always a very large wide hole deſign'd for the Mouth. Madam <hi>Dacier,</hi> who met with the Draughts of the Comick Vizards in a very old Manuſcript <hi>Terence,</hi> informs us, that they were not like ours which cover only the Face: But that they came over the whole Head, and had always a ſort of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruque of Hair faſten'd on them, proper to the Perſon whom they were to repreſent.</p>
                  <p>The Original of the Maſque is referr'd by <hi>Horace</hi> to <hi>Aeſchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus;</hi> whereas before the Actors had not other diſguiſe, but to
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:66439:173"/>ſmear over their Faces with odd Colours; and yet this was well enough when their Stage was no better than a Cart.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Chorus Hedelin</hi> defines to be, a Company of Actors, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the Aſſembly, or Body of thoſe Perſons, who either were preſent, or probably might be ſo, upon that Place or Scent, where the buſineſs was ſuppos'd to be tranſacted. This is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly obſerv'd in the four <hi>Graecian</hi> Dramatick Poets, <hi>Aeſchylus, Sophocles, Euripides,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtophanes:</hi> But the only <hi>Latin</hi> Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies which remain, thoſe under the Name of <hi>Seneca,</hi> as they are faulty in many Reſpects, ſo particularly are they in the <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus's:</hi> For ſometimes they hear all that's ſaid upon the Stage, ſee all that's done, and ſpeak very properly to all: At other times one wou'd think they were blind, deaf, or dumb. In ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe <hi>Drama's</hi> one can hardly tell whom they repreſent, how they were dreſs'd, what reaſon brings them on the Stage, or why they are of one Sex more than of another. Indeed the Verſes are fine, full of Thought, and over-loaded with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit; but may in moſt places be very well ſpar'd, without ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing either in the Sence or the Repreſentation of the Poem. Beſides, the <hi>Thebais</hi> has no <hi>Chorus</hi> at all; which may give us occaſion to doubt of what <hi>Scaliger</hi> affirms ſo poſitively, That Tragedy was never without <hi>Chorus's.</hi> For it ſeems probable enough, that in the time of the debauch'd and looſe Emperours, when Mimicks and Buſſoons came in for Interludes to Tragedy as well as Comedy, the <hi>Chorus</hi> ceas'd by degrees to be a part of
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:66439:173"/>the Dramatick Poem, and dwindled into a Troop of Muſicians and Dancers, who mark'd the Intervals of the Acts.</p>

                  <p>This Account is chiefly to be underſtood of the <hi>Chorus</hi> of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies; yet the old Comedies, we are aſſur'd, had their <hi>Chorus's</hi> too, as yet appears in <hi>Ariſtophanes;</hi> where, beſides thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of the ordinary ſort of Perſons, we meet with one of Clouds, another of Frogs, and a third of Waſps; but all very conformable to the nature of the Subject, and extremely Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical.</p>
                  <p>'Twould be foreign to our preſent purpoſe to trace the Original of the <hi>Chorus,</hi> and to ſhew how it was regulated by <hi>Theſpis,</hi> (gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally honour'd with the Title of the firſt Tragedian;) whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'twas nothing elſe but a Company of Muſicians ſinging and dancing in honour of <hi>Bacchus.</hi> It may be more proper to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, how it came, after ſome time, to be left out in Comedy, as it is in that of the <hi>Romans. Horace</hi>'s Reaſon is, that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity and Satyrical Humour of the Poets was the cauſe of it; for they made the <hi>Chorus's</hi> abuſe People ſo ſeverely, and with ſo bare a Face, that the Magiſtrates at laſt forbad them to uſe any at all.</p>

                  <p>But perhaps, if the Rules of probability had not likewiſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded this Prohibition, the Poets would have preſerv'd their <hi>Chorus</hi> ſtill, bating the Satirical Edge of it. Therefore a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reaſon may be offer'd for this Alteration. Comedy took its Model and Conſtitution from Tragedy; and when the down-right abuſing of living Perſons was prohibited, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented new Subjects which they govern'd by the Rules of Tragedy; but as they were neceſſitated to paint the Actions of the Vulgar, and conſequently confin'd to mean Events, they generally choſe the place of their Scene in ſome Street before the Houſes of thoſe whom they ſuppos'd concern'd in the Plot: Now it was not very likely that there ſhould be ſuch a Company in thoſe places, managing an Intrigue of inconſiderable Perſons from Morning 'till Night. Thus Comedy of it ſelf let fall the <hi>Chorus,</hi> which it could not preſerve with any probability.</p>

The Performers of the Muſick (ſays ſhe) play'd always on two Flutes, the whole time of the Comedy. That which they ſtopp'd with their Right-hand was on that Account call'd Right-handed; and that which they ſtopp'd with their Left, Left-handed. The firſt had but a few Holes, and ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a deep Baſe; the other had a greater number of Holes, and gave a ſhriller and ſharper Note. When the Muſicians play'd on two Flutes of a different Sound, they us'd to ſay the Piece was play'd <hi>tibiis imparibus,</hi> with <hi>unequal Flutes,</hi> or <hi>Tibiis dextris &amp; ſiniſtris,</hi> with <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Left-handed Flutes.</hi> When they play'd on two Flutes of the ſame ſound, they us'd to ſay, the Muſick was perform'd <hi>tibiis paribus dextris,</hi> on <hi>equal Right-hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> Flutes, if they were of the deeper ſort; or elſe <hi>tibiis paribus ſiniſtris,</hi> on <hi>equal Left-handed</hi> Flutes, if they were thoſe of the ſhriller Note.</p>

                  <p>The Title of <hi>Terence</hi>'s <hi>Andria</hi> cannot be made out according to this Explanation, unleſs we ſuppoſe (as there is very good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) that the Muſick ſometimes chang'd in the acting of a Play; and at the proper Intervals, two Right-handed, and two Left-handed Flutes might be us'd.</p>
                  <p>Our late ingenious Tranſlators of <hi>Terence,</hi> are of a different opinion from the <hi>French</hi> Lady, when they render <hi>tibiis paribis dextris &amp; ſiniſtris, two equal Flutes, the one Right-handed, and the other Left-handed:</hi> Whereas the Muſick ſhould ſeem rather to have been performed all along on two equal Flutes, ſometimes on two Right-handed, and ſometimes on two Left-handed.</p>
                  <p>Old <hi>Donatus</hi> would have us believe, that the Right-handed, or <hi>Lydian</hi> Flutes denoted the more ſerious Matter and Language of the Comedy: That the Left-handed, or <hi>Sarranae</hi> were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to expreſs the lightneſs of a more jocoſe Stile: And that when a Right-handed Flute was join'd with a Left-handed, it gave us to underſtand the mixture of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and Mirth in the ſame Play. But ſince the Title of the <hi>Heautontimoroumenos,</hi> or ſelf <hi>Self-tormentor,</hi> informs us, that the Muſick was perform'd, the firſt time of Acting on unequal Flutes, and the ſecond time on Right-handed Flutes, we cannot agree with the old Scholiaſt, without ſuppoſing the ſame Play, at one time to be partly ſerious and partly merry, and at another time to be wholly of the graver ſort; which would be ridiculous to imagine. Therefore the ingenious Lady happily advanceth a very fair Opinion, That the Muſick was not guided by the Subject of the Play, but by the occaſion on which it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented. Thus in the Pieces which were acted at Funeral Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the Muſick was perform'd on two Right-handed Flutes, as the moſt grave and Melancholy: In thoſe acted on any joyful Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, the Muſick conſiſted of two Left-handed Flutes, as the briskeſt and moſt airy. But in the great Feſtivals of the Gods, which participated of an equal ſhare of Mirth and Religion, the Muſick in the Comedies was perform'd with unequal Flutes, the one Right-handed, and the other Left-handed; or elſe by turns, ſometimes on two Right-handed Flutes, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:66439:175"/>on two Left-handed, as may be judg'd of <hi>Terence</hi>'s fair <hi>Indrian.</hi>

                  <p>THE Sacred Games, being inſtituted on ſeveral occaſion to the Honour of ſeveral Deities, are divided into many Species, all which very frequently occur in Authors, and may be thus in ſhort deſcrib'd.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>L<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>DI MEGALENSES</hi> were inſtituted to the Honour of the great Goddeſs, or the Mother of the Gods, when her Statue was brought with ſo much Pomp from <hi>Peſſinum</hi> to <hi>Rome.</hi> They conſiſted only of Scenical Sports, and were a ſolemn time of Invitation to Entertainments among Friends. In the ſolemn Proceſſion the Women danc'd before the Image of the Goddeſs; and the Magiſtrates appear'd in all their Robes; whence came the Phraſe of <hi>Purpura Megalenſis.</hi> They laſted ſix Days, from the Day before the Nones of <hi>April</hi> to the Ides. At firſt they ſeem to have been call'd the <hi>Megalenſia,</hi> from <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>The <hi>L<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>DI CEREALES</hi> were deſign'd to the Honour of <hi>Ceres,</hi> and borrow'd from <hi>Eleuſine</hi> in <hi>Greece.</hi> In theſe Games the Matrons repreſented the Grief of <hi>Ceres,</hi> after ſhe had loſt her Daughter <hi>Proſerpine,</hi> and her Travails to find her again. They were held from the Day before the Ides of <hi>April,</hi> eight Days together in the <hi>Circus,</hi> where, beſides the Combats of Horſemen and other Diverſions, was led up the <hi>Pompa Circenſis,</hi> or <hi>Ceres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> conſiſting of a ſolemn Proceſſion of the Perſons that were to engage in the Exerciſes, accompanied with the Magiſtrates and Ladies of Quality, the Statues of the Gods and of famous Men, being carried along in State on Waggons, which they call'd <hi>Thenſae.</hi>

                     <hi>L<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>DI FLORALES,</hi> ſacred to <hi>Flora,</hi> and celebrated (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on advice of the <hi>Sibylline</hi> Oracles) every Spring to beg a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on the Graſs, Trees, and Flowers. Some are of opinion, that they owe their Original to a famous Whore, who having gain'd a great Eſtate by her Trade, left the Commonwealth her Heir,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:66439:176"/>with this Condition, that every Year they ſhould celebrate her Birth-day with publick Sports: The Magiſtrates, to avoid ſuch a publick Scandal, and at the ſame time to keep their Promiſe, held the Games on the Day appointed, but pretended that it was done in Honour of a new Goddeſs, the Patroneſs of Flowers. Whether this Conjecture be true or no, we are certain that the main part of the Solemnity was manag'd by a Company of lewd Strumpets, who ran up and down naked, ſometimes dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, ſometimes fighting, or acting the Mimicks. However it came to paſs, the wiſeſt and graveſt <hi>Romans</hi> were not for diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing this Cuſtom, tho' the moſt indecent imaginable: For <hi>Porcius Cato</hi> when he was preſent at theſe Games, and ſaw the People aſham'd to let the Maids ſtrip while he was there, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately went out of the Theatre, to let the Ceremony have its Courſe<note n="(a)" place="bottom">

Monſieur <hi>Dacier</hi> in his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Remarks on the Secular Poem of <hi>Horace,</hi> paſſes by this old Conceit as trivial and fabulous, and aſſures us, that we need go no farther for the riſe of the Cuſtom, than to the <hi>Sibylline</hi> Oracles, for which the <hi>Romans</hi> had ſo great an Eſteem and Veneration.</p>
                  <p>In theſe ſacred Writings there was one famous Prophecy to this effect; That if the <hi>Romans</hi> at the beginning of every Age ſhould hold ſolemn Games in the <hi>Campus Martius</hi> to the Honour of <hi>Pluto, Proſerpine, Juno, Apollo, Diana, Ceres,</hi> and the <hi>Parcae,</hi> or three fatal Siſters, their City ſhould ever flouriſh, and all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be ſubjected to their Dominion. They were very ready to obey the Oracle, and in all the Ceremonies us'd on that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion conform'd themſelves to its Directions. The whole manner
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:66439:178"/>of the Solemnity was as follows: In the firſt place the Heralds receiv'd Orders to make an invitation of the whole World, to come to a Feaſt which they had never ſeen already, and ſhould never ſee again. Some few Days before the beginning of the Games, the <hi>Quindecemviri,</hi> taking their Seats in the Capitol and in the <hi>Palatine</hi> Temple, diſtributed among the People Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of purifying Stuff, as Flambeaus, Brimſtone, and Sulphur. From hence the People paſs'd on to <hi>Diana</hi>'s Temple on the <hi>Aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> Mountain, carrying Wheat, Barley, and Beans as an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering; and after this they ſpent whole Nights in Devotion to the Deſtinies. At length, when the time of the Games was actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally come, which continu'd three Days and three Nights, the People aſſembled in the <hi>Campus Martius,</hi> and ſacrificed to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter, Juno, Apollo, Latona, Diana,</hi> the <hi>Parcae, Ceres, Pluto,</hi> and <hi>Proſerpine.</hi> On the firſt Night of the Feaſt, the Emperour, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by the <hi>Quindecemviri,</hi> commanded three Altars to be rais'd on the Bank of <hi>Tyber,</hi> which they ſprinkled with the Blood of three Lambs, and then proceeded to burn the Offerings and the Victims. After this they mark'd out a Space which ſerv'd for a Theatre, being illuminated by an innumerable multitude of Flambeaus and Fires; here they ſung ſome certain Hymns compos'd on this occaſion, and celebrated all kinds of Sports. On the Day after, when they had been at the Capitol to offer the Victims, they return'd to the <hi>Campus Martius,</hi> and held Sports to the Honour of <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Diana.</hi> Theſe laſted 'till the next Day, when the noble Matrons, at the hour appointed by the Oracle, went to the Capitol to ſing Hymns to <hi>Jupiter.</hi> On the third Day which concluded the Feaſt, twenty ſeven young Boys, and as many Girls ſung in the Temple of <hi>Palatine Apollo</hi> Hymns and Verſes in <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> to recommend the City to the Protection of thoſe Deities, whom they deſign'd parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to honour by their Sacrifices.</p>
                  <p>The famous Secular Poem of <hi>Horace</hi> was compos'd for this laſt Day, in the Secular Games held by <hi>Auguſtus. Dacier</hi> has given his Judgment on this Poem, as the Maſter-piece of <hi>Horace,</hi> and believes, that all Antiquity cannot furniſh us with any thing more happily compleat.</p>
                  <p>There has been much Controverſie, whether theſe Games were celebrated every hundred or every hundred and ten Years. For the former Opinion <hi>Cenſorinus</hi>
                     <note n="(l)" place="bottom">De <hi>Die Natali,</hi> cap. 17.</note> alledges the Teſtimony of <hi>Valerius Antias, Varro,</hi> and <hi>Livy;</hi> and this was certainly the
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:66439:178"/>ſpace of time which the <hi>Romans</hi> call'd, <hi>Saeculum,</hi> or an Age. For the latter he produceth the Authority of the Regiſters, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries of the <hi>Quindecemviri,</hi> and the Edicts of <hi>Auguſtus;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the plain Evidence of <hi>Horace</hi> in his Secular Poem.</p>

                  <p>This Diſorder without queſtion was owing to the Ambition of the Emperours, who were extreamly deſirous to have the Honour of celebrating theſe Games in their Reign; and therefore, upon the ſlighteſt Pretence many times, made them return before their ordinary Courſe. Thus <hi>Claudius</hi> pretended, that <hi>Auguſtus</hi> had held the Games before their due time, that he might have the leaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe to keep them within ſixty four Years afterwards. On which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>Suetonius</hi> tells us, that the People ſcoffed his Cryers, when they went about proclaiming Games that no Body had ever ſeen, nor would ſee again; whereas there were not only many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons alive who remembred the Games of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> but ſeveral Players who had acted in thoſe Games, were now again brought on the Stage by <hi>Claudius</hi>

                  <p>We may conclude our Enquiry into this celebrated Subject with two excellent Remarks of the <hi>French</hi> Critick. The firſt is,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:66439:179"/>that in the number Three, ſo much regarded in theſe Games, they had probably an Alluſion to the Triplicity of <hi>Phoebus,</hi> of <hi>Diana,</hi> and of the Deſtinies.</p>
                  <p>The other Obſervation which he obliges us with, is, that they thought the Girls which had the honour to bear a part in ſinging the Secular Poem ſhould be the ſooneſt married. This Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they borrow'd from the Theology of the <hi>Graecians,</hi> who imagin'd that the Children who did not ſing and dance at the coming of <hi>Apollo,</hi> ſhould never be married, and ſhould certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly die young. To this purpoſe <hi>Callimachus</hi> in his Hymn to <hi>Apollo.</hi>

                  <p>THE <hi>Roman</hi> Habit has given as much trouble to the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks as any other part of Antiquity: And tho' the moſt learned Men have been ſo kind as to leave us their Thoughts on this Subject, yet the Matter is not fully explain'd, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies about it admit of no Deciſion. However, without enquiring into the ſeveral Faſhions of the <hi>Romans,</hi> or defining the exact time when they firſt chang'd their leathern Jerkins, and their primitive Hides of wild Beaſts, for the more decent and graceful Attires; it will be ſufficient to the preſent deſign, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſeveral ſorts of Garments in uſe with both Sexes, and to give the beſt diſtinction of them that can be found out at this diſtance.</p>
                  <p>The two common and celebrated Garments of the <hi>Romans,</hi> were the <hi>Toga</hi> and the <hi>Tunica.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Toga,</hi> or Gown ſeems to have been of a Semicircular Form, without Sleeves, different in largeneſs according to the Wealth or Poverty of the wearer; and us'd only upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of appearing in publick; whence 'tis often call'd <hi>Veſtis fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renſis</hi>

                  <p>The Colour of the Gown is generally believ'd to have been White. The common Objections againſt this Opinion are, how it could then be diſtinguiſh'd from the <hi>Toga Candida,</hi> us'd by Competitors for Offices; or how it comes to paſs that we read particularly of their wearing white Gowns on Holy-days and publick Feſtivals; as in <hi>Horace;</hi>

                  <p>The Diſpute between <hi>Manutius</hi> and <hi>Sigonius,</hi> whether the <hi>Roman</hi> Gown was tied about with a Girdle or not, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly decided in favour of <hi>Manutius.</hi> Yet it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd, that the beſt Authors allow ſome kind of <hi>Cincture</hi> to the Gown; but then it muſt be underſtood to be perform'd only by help of the Gown it ſelf; or by that part of it, which coming under the Right Arm, was drawn over to the Left Shoulder, and ſo covering the <hi>

                  <p>The accurate <hi>Ferrarius</hi> is certainly in a miſtake as to this Point; for, maintaining that the Gown had no kind of <hi>cinctus</hi> but what they call'd <hi>Gabinus,</hi> he will have this meant only of the <hi>Tunica:</hi> But the plain Words of <hi>Macrobius</hi> make this Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition impoſſible; and <hi>Lacinium trahere</hi> expreſly points out the Gown; for the <hi>Tunick</hi> being only a ſhort Veſt, cannot by any means be conceiv'd to have a Lappet dragging on the Ground<note n="(g)" place="bottom">Graevius <hi>ad</hi> Sueton.

                  <p>The ſeveral ſorts of the <hi>Roman</hi> Gowns were the <hi>Toga Praetexta,</hi> the <hi>Pulla,</hi> the <hi>Sordida,</hi> and the <hi>Picta, Purpurea, Palmata,</hi> &amp;c. or the <hi>Trabea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Every one knows that the Gown was the diſtinguiſhing Mark of the <hi>Romans</hi> from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who wore the <hi>Pallium</hi> or Cloak as their common Garment; whence <hi>Togatus</hi> and <hi>Palliatus</hi> are often us'd for <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Graecian.</hi> As alſo, that the Gown was the proper Badge of Peace, being generally laid aſide upon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging in any martial Deſign. Yet it appears from ſeveral Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of <hi>Livy</hi> and <hi>Plutarch,</hi> that it was ſometimes worn in the Camp.

                  <p>The <hi>Toga Praetexta</hi> had a Border of Purple round the Edges whence it took its Name, and in alluſion to which the <hi>Graecian</hi> Writers call it <gap reason="foreign">

Some fanſie that <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinius Priſcus</hi> in a Triumph for a Victory againſt the <hi>Sabines,</hi> firſt honour'd his own Son with the <hi>Praetexta</hi> and the <hi>Bulla aurea</hi> as Rewards of his Valour for killing one of the Enemies with his own Hands. For as the former was the Robe of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, ſo the <hi>Bulla aurea</hi> was 'till then us'd only by Generals in their Triumphal Proceſſion; being a ſort of hollow golden Ball hanging about their Necks, in which was inclos'd ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Amulet, or Preſervative againſt Envy. Others, without regarding this firſt Story, tell us, that the ſame <hi>Tarquin</hi> among other wiſe Conſtitutions, took particular Care in aſſigning the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Habit to the Boys, and accordingly ordain'd that the Sons of Noblemen ſhould make uſe of the <hi>Praetexta,</hi> and the <hi>Bulla aurea,</hi>

A third Party referr the Original of this Cuſtom to <hi>Romulus</hi> himſelf, as the Conſequence of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to the <hi>Sabine</hi> Virgins, that he'd beſtow a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Mark of Honour on the firſt Child that was born to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them by a <hi>Roman</hi> Father. Many believe that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of giving them the <hi>Bulla</hi> and the <hi>Praetexta</hi> was, that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, being ſhap'd like a Heart, might as often as they look'd on it be no inconſiderable incitement to Courage; and that the Purple of the Gown might remind them of the Modeſty which became them at that Age<note n="(m)" place="bottom">

                  <p>The <hi>Toga pulla</hi> and <hi>Sordida</hi> are very commonly confounded. Yet upon a ſtrict Enquiry it will appear that the firſt ſort was proper to Perſons in Mourning, being made of black Cloath, whence the Perſons were call'd <hi>atrati.</hi> The <hi>Toga ſordida</hi> was Black as well as the other, but from a different Cauſe, having grown ſo by the long wearing and ſullying of it: And this (as has been already obſerv'd) was worn by the Priſoners at their Tryal, as well as by the ordinary People. It may here be remark'd that the <hi>Pullati</hi> whom we meet with in the Claſſics, were not only thoſe who wore the <hi>Toga pulla</hi> or the <hi>Toga ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dida,</hi> but ſuch too as were attir'd in the <hi>Penulae</hi> or <hi>Lacernae</hi> which were uſually Black.

                  <p>There are ſeveral other Names under which we ſometimes find the Gown, which have not yet been explained, nor wou'd be of much Uſe if throughly underſtood: Such as the <hi>Toga un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulata, ſcriculata, raſa, paverata, Phryxiana, ſcutulata,</hi> &amp;c. See <hi>Ferrar.</hi> de Re Veſt. lib. 2. cap. 10.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Tunica,</hi> or cloſe Coat, was the common Garment worn within Doors by it ſelf, and abroad under the Gown. The old <hi>Romans</hi> (as <hi>Gellius</hi> informs us<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Lib. 7. cap. 12.</note>) at firſt were cloath'd only in the Gown. In a little time they found the Convenience of a ſhort ſtrait <hi>Tunic,</hi> that did not cover the Arms; ſuch as the <hi>Graecians</hi> call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Afterwards they had Sleeves coming down to the Elbow, but no farther. Hence <hi>Suetonius</hi> tell's us that <hi>Caeſar</hi> was remarkable in his Habit, becauſe he wore the <hi>Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clavian Tunick,</hi> clos'd with Gatherings about his Wriſt<note n="(b)" place="bottom">

                  <p>Yet in the Declenſion of the Empire, the <hi>Tunies</hi> did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reach down to the Ankles, whence they were call'd <hi>Talares,</hi> but had Sleeves too coming down to the Hands, which gave them the Name of <hi>Chitodotae.</hi> And now it was counted as Scandalous to appear without Sleeves, as it had been hitherto to be ſeen in them. And therefore in the Writers of that Age, we commonly find the accuſed Perſons at a Tryal habited in the <hi>Tunick</hi> without Sleeves, as a mark of Infamy and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace<note n="(e)" place="bottom">ibidem.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The ſeveral ſorts of the <hi>Tunic,</hi> were the <hi>Palmata,</hi> the <hi>Angu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticlavia,</hi> and the <hi>Laticlavia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Tunica Palmata</hi> was worn by Generals in a Triumph, and perhaps always under the <hi>Toga picta.</hi> It had its Name ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the great breadth of the <hi>Clavi,</hi> equal to the Palm of the Hand; or elſe from the Figures of Palms, embroyder'd on it<note n="(f)" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Feſtus</hi> in voce.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The whole Body of the Criticks are ſtrangely divided about the <hi>Clavi.</hi> Some fanſie them to have been a kind of Flowers
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:66439:185"/>interwoven in the Cloth: Others will have them to be the But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons or Claſps by which the <hi>Tunick</hi> was held together. A Third ſort contend that the <hi>Latus clavus</hi> was nothing elſe but a <hi>Tunic,</hi> border'd with Purple. <hi>Scaliger</hi> thinks the <hi>Clavi</hi> did not belong properly to the Veſt, but hung down from the Neck, like Chains, and Ornaments of that Nature. But the moſt general Opinion makes them to have been Studs or Purls ſomething like Heads of Nails, of Purple or Gold work'd into the <hi>Tunic.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All the former Conjectures are learnedly refuted by the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate <hi>Rubenius,</hi> who endeavours to prove, that the <hi>clavi</hi> were no more than purple Lines or Streaks coming along the middle of the Garments, which were afterwards improv'd to golden and embroyder'd Lines of the ſame Nature. We muſt not therefore ſuppoſe them to have receiv'd their Name, as an immediate al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion to the Heads of Nails, to which they bore no Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance; but may remember that the Ancients us'd to inlay their Cups and other precious Utenſils with Studs of Gold, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ornamental Materials. Theſe from their likeneſs to Nail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads they call'd in general <hi>Clavi.</hi> So that it was very natural to bring the ſame Word to ſignifie theſe Lines of Purple or other Colours which were of a different Kind from all the reſt of the Garment; as thoſe ancient <hi>Clavi</hi> were of a different Colour and Figure from the Veſſels which they adorn'd.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Streaks were either tranſverſe or ſtraight down the Veſt; the former were uſed only in the Liveries of the <hi>Popes</hi> and other publick Servants; by the Muſicians, and ſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of Artificers, and now and then by the Woman; being term'd <hi>Paragaudae.</hi> The proper <hi>Clavi</hi> came ſtraight down the Veſt, one of them making the <hi>Tunic,</hi> which they call'd the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſticlave, and two the Laticlave.</p>
                  <p>However this Opinion has been applauded by the Learned, Monſieur <hi>Dacier</hi>'s Judgment of the Matter cannot fail to meet with as kind Reception.</p>
                  <p>He tells us that the <hi>Clavi</hi> were no more than purple Galoons, with which they border'd the fore Part of the <hi>Tunic,</hi> on both Sides, in the Place where it came together. The broad Galoons made the <hi>Laticlave,</hi> and the narrow the <hi>Anguſticlave.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are ſtrangely miſtaken who make the only Difference between the two Veſts to conſiſt in this, that the one had but a ſingle <hi>Clavus,</hi> the other two, and that the Senatorian <hi>Clavus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the middle of the Veſt cou'd poſſibly be but one. For 'tis very plain they had each of them two Galoons binding the two Sides of the Coat where it open'd before; ſo that joining
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:66439:185"/>together with the Sides they appear' juſt in the Middle; whence the <hi>Greeks</hi> call'd ſuch a Veſt <gap reason="foreign">

Beſides both theſe Authorities <hi>Lampridius</hi> in the Life of <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> confirms the preſent Aſſertion. He acquaints us that the aforeſaid Emperour had ſome Thoughts of aſſigning a proper Habit to Servants different from that of their Maſters: But his great Lawyers <hi>

                  <p>The Prieſts were remarkable for their modeſty in Apparel, and therefore they made uſe only of the Common-purple, never affecting the more Chargeable and Splendid. Thus <hi>Cicero, Veſtitus aſper noſtrâ hâc purpurâ plebeiâ ac penè fuſcâ</hi>

                  <p>There are two farther Remarks which may be made in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Habits in general. Firſt that in the time of any publick Calamity, 'twas an uſual Cuſtom to change their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, as an Argument of Humility and Contrition; of which we meet with many Inſtances in Hiſtory. On ſuch Occaſions the Senators laid by the <hi>Laticlave,</hi> and appear'd only in the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of Knights. The Magiſtrates threw aſide the <hi>Praetexta,</hi> and came abroad in the Senatorian Garb.

                  <p>The other Remark is the Obſervation of the great <hi>Caſaubon,</hi> that the Habit of the Ancients; and particularly of the <hi>Romans,</hi> in no Reſpect differ'd more from the Modern Dreſs, than in that they had nothing anſwering to our Breeches and Stockins which if we were to expreſs in <hi>Latin,</hi> we ſhou'd call <hi>femoralia</hi> and <hi>tibialia.</hi> Yet inſtead of theſe under their lower Tunics or Waſtcoats, they ſometimes bound their Thighs and Legs round with Silken Scarfs or <hi>faſciae;</hi> tho' theſe had now and then the Name of <hi>foeminalia</hi> or <hi>femoralia</hi> and <hi>tibialia,</hi> from the Parts to which they were apply'd<note n="(x)" place="bottom">

                  <p>Some have thought that the Women (on ſome Account or other) wore the <hi>Lacerna</hi> too: But the riſe of this Fancy is owing to their Miſtake of that Verſe in <hi>Juvenal,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Attire of the Head and Feet will take in all that remains of this Subject. As to the firſt of theſe it has been a former Remark that the <hi>Romans</hi> ordinarily us'd none, except the Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit of their Gown; and this was not a conſtant Cover, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly occaſional, to avoid the Rain, or Sun, or other accidental Inconveniences.

Some Perſons too were allow'd to have their Heads always cover'd; as Men who had been lately made Free, and were there upon ſhav'd cloſe on their Head, might wear the <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leus,</hi> both as a Defence from the Cold, and as a Badge of their Liberty. And the ſame Privilege was granted to Perſons under any Indiſpoſition<note n="(g)" place="bottom">

                  <p>As for the ſeveral ſorts of Coverings deſign'd for theſe Uſes, many of them have been long confounded beyond any poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Diſtinction: And the Learned <hi>Salmaſius</hi>

                  <p>The Eſpouſals or Contract before Marriage was perform'd by an Engagement of the Friends on both Sides, and might be done as well between abſent Perſons as Preſent; as well in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, as before Witneſſes. Yet the common Way of Betrothing was by Writings drawn up by common Conſent, and ſeal'd by both Parties. Thus <hi>Juvenal</hi> Sat. 6.</p>

So much indeed muſt be granted that tho' the Laws made thoſe Husbands liable to a Penalty who either hir'd out their Wives for Money, or kept them after they had been actually convicted of Adultery; yet the bare permiſſion of that Crime did not fall under the Notice of the civil Power.

                        <hi>Quintus Hortenſius,</hi> a Man of ſignal Worth, and approved Virtue, was not content to live in Friendſhip and Familiarity with <hi>Cato,</hi> but deſir'd alſo to be united to his Family, by ſome alliance in Marriage. Therefore waiting upon <hi>Cato</hi> he begun to make a propoſal about taking <hi>Cato</hi>'s Daughter <hi>Porcia</hi> from <hi>Bibulus,</hi> to whom ſhe had already born three Children, and making her his own Wife, offering to reſtore her after ſhe
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:66439:195"/>had born him a Child, if <hi>Bibulus</hi> was not willing to part with her altogether: Adding that tho' this in the Opinion of Men might ſeem Strange, yet in Nature it wou'd appear Honeſt and Profitable to the Publick, with much more to the ſame Purpoſe. <hi>Cato</hi> cou'd not but expreſs his Wonder at the ſtrange Project, but withal approv'd very well of uniting their Houſes: When <hi>Hortenſius</hi> turning the Diſcourſe did not ſtick to acknowledge, that it was <hi>Cato</hi>'s own Wife which he really deſir'd. <hi>Cato</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his earneſt Inclinations, did not deny his Requeſt, but ſaid that <hi>Philip</hi> the Father of <hi>Martia</hi> ought alſo to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted. <hi>Philip,</hi> being ſent for, came, and finding they were well agreed, gave his Daughter <hi>Martia</hi> to <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> in the preſence of <hi>Cato,</hi> who himſelf alſo aſſiſted at the Marriage.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that this was nothing like lending a Wife out, but actually marrying her to another while her firſt Husband was alive, to whom ſhe may be ſuppos'd to have came by that kind of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony which is founded in the right of Poſſeſſion. And upon the whole the <hi>Romans</hi> ſeem to have been hitherto Unjuſtly Taxed with the Allowance of a Cuſtom not uſually practis'd among the moſt barbarous and ſavage part of Mankind.</p>

                  <p>To prove that both theſe ways of Burial were us'd by the <hi>Romans</hi> is almoſt unneceſſary. For Burning is known by every one to have been their common Practice.

                  <p>The ſeveral ſorts of Funerals fall under the common Heads of <hi>Funus indictivum</hi> and <hi>Funus tacitum.</hi> The <hi>funus indictivum</hi> had its Name <hi>ab indicendo</hi> from inviting, becauſe on ſuch Occaſions there was made a general Invitation of the People by the Mouth of a publick Cryer. This was celebrated with extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Splendor and Magnificence, the People being preſented with publick Shows and other uncommon Divertiſements. The <hi>Funus Publicum</hi> which we meet with ſo often, may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times underſtood as entirely the ſame with the <hi>Indictive</hi> Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and ſometimes only as a ſpecies of it. It is the ſame when it denotes all the State and Grandeur of the more noble Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, ſuch as were uſually kept for rich and great Men. It is only a ſpecies of the <hi>Indictive</hi> Funeral, when either it ſignifies the proclaiming of a <hi>Vacation,</hi> and an enjoyment of publick Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, or the defraying the Charges of the Funeral out of the Publick Stock. For 'tis probable that at both theſe Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties a general Invitation was made by the Cryer, yet in this Latter it was done by Order of the Senate, and in the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer by the Will of the deceas'd Perſon, or the Pleaſure of his Heirs. But no one will hence conclude that the Funerals of all ſuch rich Men were attended with the Formality of a <hi>Vacation,</hi> and an Order for Publick Grief. For this was counted the greateſt Honour that cou'd be ſhow'd to the Relicks of Princes themſelves: Thus the Senate decreed a Publick Funeral for <hi>Syphax</hi> the once great King of <hi>Numidia;</hi> and for <hi>Perſes</hi> King of <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> who both died in Priſon under the Power of the <hi>Romans</hi>

<pb n="330" facs="tcp:66439:198"/>buried in the ſame State. Yet upon account of having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd any ſignal Service to the Common-wealth, this Honour was often conferr'd on private Men: and ſometimes upon Women too, as <hi>Dio</hi> relates of <hi>Attia</hi> the Mother of <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi>

                  <p>There ſeem to have been different ſorts of <hi>Publick Funerals</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi> according to the Magiſtracies or other Honours which the deceaſed Perſons had born. As the <hi>Praetorium,</hi> the <hi>Conſulare,</hi> the <hi>Cenſorium</hi> and the <hi>Triumphale.</hi> The Two laſt were by much the more Magnificent, which tho' formerly diſtinguiſh'd, yet in the time of the Emperours were join'd in One with the name of <hi>funus cenſorium</hi> only; as <hi>Tacitus</hi> often uſeth the Phraſe. Nor was <hi>Cenſorian</hi> Funeral conſin'd to Private Perſons, but the very Emperours themſelves were honour'd with the like Solemnity after their Deaths; as <hi>Tacitus</hi> reports of <hi>Claudius</hi>
                     <note n="(o)" place="bottom">Annal. 12.</note> and <hi>Capito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus</hi> of <hi>Pertinax.</hi>

                  <p>When all Hopes of Life were now given o'er, and the Soul as it were juſt ready for its flight, the Friends, and neareſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of the dying Party were wont to kiſs him, and embrace his Body 'till he expired. Thus <hi>Suetonius</hi>

It may only here be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd that this Ceremony was perform'd for the moſt part by the neareſt relation, as by Husbands to their Wives, and by Wives to their Husbands, by Parents to their Children, and by Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to their Parents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of all which we have a multitude of Inſtances in the Poets. <hi>Pliny</hi> tells us that as they clos'd the Eyes of the dying Perſons, ſo they open'd them too again when the Body was laid on the Funeral-Pile: And his Reaſon for both Cuſtoms is, <hi>ut neque ab homine ſupremùm ſpectari fas ſit, &amp; coelo non oſtendi nefas</hi>
                     <note n="(u)" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Valer. Max.</hi> lib. 11. cap. 37.</note>; <hi>becauſe they counted it equally impious, that the Eyes ſhou'd be ſeen by men at their laſt motion, or that they ſhou'd not be expoſed to the view of Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for the Ceremonies us'd to Perſons after they were dead, they may be divided into Three Sorts, ſuch as were perform'd before the Burial, ſuch as concern'd the Act of the Funeral, and ſuch as were done after that ſolemnity.</p>
                  <p>Before the Burial we meet with the Cuſtoms of waſhing and anointing the Corpſe, not by any means proper to the <hi>Romans,</hi> but anciently us'd by almoſt all the civiliz'd Parts of the World, owing their firſt Riſe to the Invention of the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> Theſe Offices in <hi>Rome</hi> were either perform'd by the Women whom they term'd <hi>Funerae;</hi> or elſe in Richer or nobler Families by the <hi>Libitinarii,</hi> a Society of Men who got their livelihood by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring Things in order to the ſolemnization of Funerals. They had their Names from <hi>Libitina</hi> the Goddeſs who preſided over Obſequies. Hence the Word <hi>Libitina</hi> is commonly us'd for Death it ſelf; or for every thing in general relating to the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, becauſe in the Temple of that Goddeſs all neceſſaries proper on ſuch Occaſions were expos'd to Sale. <hi>Phaedrus</hi> alludes to this Cuſtom, ſpeaking of a covetous Miſer, Lib. 5. Fab. 77.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Qui circumcides omnem impenſam Funeris,</l>
                     <l>Libitina ne quid de tuo faciat lucrum.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>But, to return to the <hi>Libitinarii,</hi> they ſeem to have been the chief Perſons concern'd in ordering Funerals, undertaking the whole Care and Charge of ſuch a ſolemnity at a ſet Price; and therefore they kept a great Number of Servants to perform the working Part, ſuch as the <hi>Pollinctores,</hi> the <hi>Veſpillones,</hi> &amp;c. The firſt of theſe were employ'd to anoint the dead Body, and the others we may chance to meet with hereafter. In alluſion
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:66439:200"/>to this Cuſtom of anointing the Corpſe, <hi>Martial</hi> plays very gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilely on the Maſter of an Entertainment, where there was much Eſſence to be got, but very little Meat:</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>When the Body had been waſh'd and anointed, they proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to wrap it in a Garment: The ordinary People for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe made uſe of the common Gown, and tho' in ſome Parts of <hi>Italy</hi> the Inhabitants were ſo rude as not to wear the Gown while they liv'd, yet <hi>Juvenal</hi> informs us that they did not want it at their Death;</p>

                  <p>Thus much was done before the Funeral; <hi>in</hi> the Funeral we may take notice of the <hi>Elatio</hi> or carrying forth, and the Act of Burial.

Therefore perhaps this belong'd only to the Indictive and publick Funerals, and not to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and Silent; eſpecially not to the <hi>acerba Funera,</hi> in which Things were always huddled up with wonderful Haſte.

                  </p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>Time</hi> of carrying forth the Corpſe, anciently they made uſe only of the Night; as <hi>Servius</hi> obſerves on thoſe words of <hi>Virgil,</hi>

                  <p>The Reaſon he gives for it, is, that hereby they might avoid meeting with the Magiſtrates or Prieſts, whoſe Eyes they thought wou'd be defil'd by ſuch a ſpectacle. Hence the Funeral had its Name <hi>à funalibus</hi> from the Torches, and the <hi>Veſpillones</hi> or <hi>Veſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rones</hi> were ſo call'd from <hi>Veſpera</hi> the Evening.</p>
                  <p>Nothing is more evident than that this Cuſtom was not long obſerv'd, at leaſt not in the <hi>Publick</hi> Funerals, tho' it ſeems to have continued in the <hi>ſilent,</hi> and <hi>private,</hi> as <hi>Servius</hi> acquaints us in the ſame <hi>Place.</hi> Hence <hi>Nero</hi> took a fair excuſe for hurrying his Brother <hi>Britannicus</hi> his Body into the Grave immediately after he had ſent him out of the World. For <hi>Tacitus</hi> reports that the Emperour defended the haſty Burial which had caus'd ſo much Talk and Suſpicion, in a publick Edict, urging that it was agreeable to the old Inſtitutions, to hide ſuch untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Funerals from Mens Eyes, as ſoon as poſſible, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them with the tedious Formalities of Harangues and Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous Proceſſions. It may not be too nice a Remark, that in the more ſplendid Funerals the former part of the Day ſeems to have been deſign'd for the Proceſſion. Thus <hi>Plutarch</hi> relates of the burial of <hi>Sylla,</hi> that the <hi>Morning being very Cloudy over Head, they deferr'd carrying forth the Corpſe 'till the Ninth Hour,</hi> or Three in the Afternoon. But tho' this Cuſtom of carrying forth the Corpſe by Night in a great Meaſure ceas'd, yet the bearing of Torches and Tapers ſtill continued in Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. Thus <hi>Virgil</hi> in the Funeral of <hi>Pallas,</hi> Aen. 11.</p>

And the very Strangers and Foreigners that happen'd to be at <hi>Rome</hi> at the Death of any worthy Perſon, were very deſirous of ſignifying their Reſpect to his Memory, by the Service of carrying the Funeral-Bed, when he was to be buried: As <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> tells us in the Funeral of <hi>Paulus Aemylius,</hi> that as many <hi>Spaniards, Ligurians</hi> and <hi>Macedonians</hi> as happen'd to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the Solemnity, that were young and of vigorous Bodies, took up the Bed and bore it to the Pile.</p>

                  <p>'Tis worth obſerving, that ſometimes the Bier or Bed was cover'd, and ſometimes not. It was expos'd open if the Party had died a natural Death, and was not very much deform'd by the Change; and therefore now and then they us'd to paint the Face, eſpecially of Women, to make them appear with more Advantage to the Sight. <hi>Dio</hi> tells us in the Life of <hi>Nero,</hi> that he daub'd the Body of <hi>Britannicus</hi> over with a ſort of White-Waſh to hinder the Blueneſs of the Fleſh, and ſuch other Marks of the Poyſon from being diſcover'd; but a great Rain falling at the time of the Proceſſion, waſh'd off the Paint, and expos'd the Fatal Tokens to the View of the whole People.</p>
                  <p>But in Caſe the Viſage was very much diſtorted, or upon ſome other Account not fit to be ſhown, they threw a Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the Bed. Thus <hi>Paterculus</hi> reports that <hi>Scipio Africanus</hi> was carried forth to Burial <hi>velato capite</hi>
                     <note n="(x)" place="bottom">Lib. 2.</note>. Sometimes too when the Face or Head had been miſerably bruiſed, as if the fall of an Houſe or ſome ſuch Accident had occaſion'd the Party's Death, they us'd to encloſe the Head and Face, in a Maſque, to hinder them from appearing, and the Funerals in which this was practis'd they term'd <hi>larvata funera.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the greateſt part of the <hi>Perſons</hi> were thoſe that follow'd the Corpſe.

But at the <hi>indictive</hi> or publick Funerals the whole City flock'd together upon the General Invitation and Summons.

                  <p>'Tis no leſs obſervable that at the Funerals of their Parents, the Sons went cover'd on their Heads, and the Daughters un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd: perhaps only to recede as far as poſſible from their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Habit. Yet 'tis likely that in ordering the Sons to cover their Heads at ſuch Solemnities they had regard to the common Practice of always wearing ſomething on their Heads when they worſhip'd the Gods, and eſpecially when they were preſent at a Sacrifice.

<pb n="344" facs="tcp:66439:205"/>Knights, the Magiſtrates like <hi>Senators,</hi> &amp;c. and that the common Wear for Mourning was Black. But we may farther remark that tho' this was the ordinary Colour to expreſs their Grief, us'd alike by both Sexes; yet after the eſtabliſhment of the Empire, when abundance of Party-Colours came in Faſhion, the old Primitive White grew ſo much into contempt, that at laſt it became proper to the Women for their Mourning Cloaths.

                  <p>The invention of this Cuſtom is generally attributed to <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius Poplicola</hi> ſoon after the expulſion of the Regal Family. <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells us, that, <hi>honouring his Collegues Obſequies with a Funeral Oration, it ſo pleas'd the</hi> Romans, <hi>that it became cuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the beſt Men, to celebrate the Funerals of great Perſons with Speeches in their Commendation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor was this Honour proper to one Sex alone, for <hi>Livy</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports that <hi>the Matrons upon account of making a Collection of Gold for the deliverance of</hi> Rome <hi>from the</hi> Gauls, <hi>were allow'd as a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Favour, to have Funeral Panegyricks in the ſame manner as the Men. Plutarch</hi>'s Relation of this Matter differs from <hi>Livy</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Reaſons of the Cuſtom: <q>He acquaints us that when it was agreed after the taking of <hi>Veii,</hi> that a Bowl of Maſſy Gold ſhou'd be made and ſent to <hi>Delphi,</hi> there was ſo great a ſcarcity of Gold, and the Magiſtrates ſo puzzled in conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how to get it, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Ladies meeting together and conſulting among themſelves, out of the Golden Ornaments that they wore, contributed as much as went to the making the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, which in Weight came to eight Talents of Gold. The <hi>Senate</hi> to give them the Honour they had deſerv'd, ordain'd that Funeral Orations ſhou'd be us'd at the Obſequies of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as well as of Men, which had never been a Cuſtom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</q> But it ſeems probable that this Honour was at firſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paid to aged Matrons; ſince we learn from the ſame excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Author that there was no Preſident of any Funeral Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on a younger Woman, 'till <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> firſt made one upon the Death of his own Wife.</p>

                  <p>The next place to which the Corpſe was carried, was the place of Burning and Burial.

                  <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> follow'd the ſame Cuſtom from the very firſt building of the City, which was afterwards ſettled in a Law by the <hi>Decemviri,</hi> and often reviv'd and confirm'd by ſeveral la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Conſtitutions.

                  <p>The Places then appointed for Burial without the City were either Private or Publick; the Private Places were the Fields or Gardens belonging to particular Families. Hence <hi>Martial</hi> took the Jeſt in one of his Epigrams on a Gentleman that had buried abundance of Wives:</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Septima jam, Phileros, tibi conditur uxor in agro.</l>
                     <l>Plus nulli, Phileros, quàm tibi reddit ager.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>If it was poſſible they always buried in that part of the Field or Garden which lay neareſt to the Common Road, both to put paſſengers in mind of mortality, and to ſave the beſt part of their land. Thus <hi>Juvenal</hi> Sat. 1.</p>

                  <p>That the Body was plac'd on the Pile not by it ſelf but together with the Couch or Bed on which it lay, we have the Authority of <hi>Tibullus,</hi> Book 1. El. 1.</p>

                  <p>The Feaſts celebrated to the Honour of the Deceas'd were either Private, or Publick: The Private Feaſts were term'd <hi>Silicernia,</hi> from <hi>Silix</hi> and <hi>Coena,</hi> as if we ſhou'd ſay <hi>Suppers made on a Stone.</hi> Theſe were prepar'd both for the Dead and the Living.

There was a Cuſtom on theſe Occaſions to diſtribute a Parcel of raw Meat among the poor People, which they term'd <hi>viſceratio;</hi> tho' this was ſometimes given without the Publick Feaſts.</p>
                  <p>The Funeral Games have already been diſpatch'd among the other Shows.</p>
                  <p>As to the Cuſtom of Mourning, beſides what has been before obſerv'd by the bye, we may farther take Notice of the time appointed for that Ceremony, and ſome of the moſt remarkable Ways of expreſſing it. <q>
                        <hi>Numa</hi> (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells us in his Life) preſcrib'd Rules for regulating the Days of Mourning accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to certain Times and Ages. As for Example, a Child of Three Years, and ſo upwards to Ten, was to be mourn'd for ſo many Months as it was Years Old. And the longeſt time of Morning for any Perſon whatſoever was not to exceed the Term of Ten Months: Which alſo was the time appointed unto Widows to lament the Loſs of their deceas'd Husbands, before which they cou'd not without great Indecency paſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſecond Marriages: But in caſe their Incontinence was ſuch as cou'd not admit ſo long an Abſtinence from the Nuptial-Bed, they were to ſacrifice a Cow with a Calf for expiation of their Fault.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Romulus</hi> his Year conſiſting but of Ten Months, when <hi>Numa</hi> afterwards added two Months more, he did not alter the Time he had before ſettled for Mourning, and therefore tho' after that Time we meet with <hi>luctus annuus,</hi> or a Year's Mourning often taken upon the Death of ſome Eminent Perſon, we muſt take it only for the old Year of <hi>Romulus,</hi> or the Space of Ten Months.</p>
                  <p>There were ſeveral Accidents which often occaſion'd the concluding of a Publick or Private Mourning before the fix'd Time; ſuch as the Dedication of a Temple, the Solemnity of Publick Games or Feſtivals, the ſolemn <hi>Luſtration</hi> perform'd by the <hi>Cenſor,</hi> and the diſcharging any Vow made by a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate or General; which being Times of Publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing, wou'd have otherwiſe imply'd a Contradiction.</p>
                  <p>As to the Tokens of Private Grief they had none but what are common to moſt Nations, as the keeping their Houſe for
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:66439:211"/>ſuch a time, the avoiding all manner of Recreations and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments, and the like. But in Publick Mourning 'twas a ſingular Cuſtom to expreſs their Concern by making the Term and all Buſineſs immediately to end, and ſettling a Vacation, 'till ſuch a Period; of which we have frequent Inſtances.</p>
                  <p>The laſt Ceremony deſign'd to be ſpoken of was Conſecration. This belong'd properly to the Emperours yet we meet too with a private Conſecration which we may obſerve in our way. This was when the Friends and Relations of the Deceas'd cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niz'd him, and paid him Worſhip in Private, a piece of Reſpect commonly paid to Parents by their Children, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves in his <hi>Roman</hi> Queſtions. Yet the Parents too ſometimes conferr'd the ſame Honour on their deceas'd Children, as <hi>Cicero</hi> promiſeth to do for his Daughter <hi>Tullia,</hi> in the End of his Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; and tho' that Piece be ſuſpected as we now have it, yet the preſent Authority loſes nothing of its Force, being ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted heretofore by <hi>Lactantius,</hi> according to the Copies extant in his time.</p>
                  <p>The Publick Conſecration had its Original from the Deifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of <hi>Romulus,</hi> but was afterwards diſcontinued 'till the time of the Emperours, on moſt of whom this Honour was conferr'd. The whole Ceremony is moſt accurately deſcrib'd by <hi>Herodian</hi> in his Fourth Book, the Tranſlation of which Place may conclude this Subject.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The <hi>Romans</hi> (ſays he) have a Cuſtom to conſecrate thoſe Emperours who leave either Sons or deſign'd Succeſſors at their Death; and thoſe who receiv'd this Honour are ſaid to be enroll'd among the Gods. On this Occaſion the whole City maintain a Publick Grief, mix'd as it were with the Solemnity of a Feſtival. The true Body is buried in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sumptuous Funeral, according to the ordinary Method. But they contrive to have an Image of the Emperour in Wax, done to the Life; and this they expoſe to publick View, juſt at the entrance of the Palace Gate, on a ſtately Bed of Ivory cover'd with rich Garments of Embroyder'd Work, and Cloath of Gold. So the Image lies there all Pale, as if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a dangerous Indiſpoſition. Round the Bed there ſit, the greateſt part of the Day, on the Left-ſide, the whole Senate in Black; on the Right, the Aged Matrons, who either upon account of their Parents or Husbands are reputed Noble; they wear no Jewels or Gold, or other uſual Ornaments, but are attir'd in cloſe white Veſts, to expreſs their Sorrow and Concern. This Ceremony continues Seven Days together;
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:66439:211"/>the Phyſicians being admitted every Day to the Bed, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the Patient to grow all along worſe and worſe. At laſt when they ſuppoſe him to be dead, a ſelect Company of Young Gentlemen of the Senatorian Order take up the Bed on their Shoulders and carry it thro' the <hi>Holy Way</hi> into the old <hi>Forum,</hi> the place where the <hi>Roman</hi> Magiſtrates us'd to lay down their Offices. On both ſides there are rais'd Galleries with Seats one above another, one ſide being fill'd with a Choire of Boys all Nobly Deſcended, and of the moſt eminent <hi>Patritian</hi> Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; the other with alike Set of Ladies of Quality; who both together ſing Hymns and Paeans compos'd in very Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and Paſſionate Airs, to the Praiſe of the Deceas'd. When theſe are over, they take up the Bed again, and carry it into the <hi>Campus Martius;</hi> where, in the wideſt part of the Field, is erected a fourſquare Pile, entirely compos'd of large Planks, in Shape of a Pavilion, and exactly regular and equal in the Dimenſions. This in the inſide is fill'd up with dry Chips, but without is adorn'd with Coverlids of Cloth of Gold, and beautified with Pictures, and curious Figures in Ivory. Above this is plac'd another Frame of Wood, much leſs indeed, but ſet off with Ornaments of the ſame Nature, and having little Doors or Gates ſtanding open about it. Over this are ſet a Third and a Fourth Pile, every one being conſiderably leſs than that on which it ſtands; and ſo others perhaps, 'till they come to the leaſt of all, which forms the Top. The Figure of this Structure altogether may be compar'd to thoſe Watch Towers, which are to be ſeen in Harbours of Note, and by the Fire on their Top direct the courſe of the Ships into the Haven. After this, hoiſting up the Body into the ſecond Frame of Building, they get together a vaſt Quantity of all manner of ſweet Odours and Perſumes, whether of Fruits, Herbs, or Gums, and pour them in Heaps all about it. There being no Nation, or City, or indeed any Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Men, who do not rival one another in paying theſe laſt Preſents to their Prince. When the Place is quite ſill'd with a huge Pile of Spices and Drugs, the whole Order of Knights ride in a Solemn Proceſſion round the Structure, and imitate the Motions of the <hi>Pyrrhic</hi> Dance. Chariots too, in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry regular and decent Manner, are drove round the Pile, having the Coach-Men cloath'd in Purple, and bearing the Images of all the Illuſtrious <hi>Romans,</hi> renown'd either for their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and Adminiſtration at Home, or their Memorable At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements in War. This Pomp being finiſh'd, the Succeſſor
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:66439:212"/>to the Empire taking a Torch in his Hand, puts it to the Frame, and at the ſame time the whole Company aſſiſt in light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in ſeveral Places, when on a ſudden the Chips and Drugs catching Fire, the whole Pile is quickly conſum'd. At laſt, from the higheſt and ſmalleſt Frame of Wood, an Eagle is let looſe, which aſcending with the Flames towards the Sky is ſuppos'd to carry the Princes Soul to Heaven.</q>

                  <p>As to the manner of the Entertainment, the Gueſts in the firſt place Bath'd with the Maſter of the Feaſt, and then chang'd their ordinary Cloths for the <hi>veſtis convivalis</hi> or <hi>coenatoria,</hi> a light kind of Frock; at the ſame time having their <hi>ſoleae</hi> pull'd off by the Slaves, that they might not foul the fine Carpets, and Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture of the Beds.

The <hi>Aes</hi> then, or moſt Ancient Money, was firſt ſtamp'd by <hi>Servius Tullius,</hi> whereas formerly it was diſtinguiſh'd only by Weight and not by any Image. The firſt Image was that of <hi>Pecus</hi> or ſmall Cattel, whence it took the Name of <hi>Pecunia.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards it had on one ſide the Beak of a Ship, on the other a <hi>Janus,</hi> and ſuch were the Stamps of the <hi>As:</hi> For as for the <hi>Triens, Quadrans,</hi> and <hi>Sextans,</hi> they had the Impreſſion of a Boat upon them. A long Time did the <hi>Romans</hi> uſe this and no other Money 'till after the War with <hi>Pyrrbus</hi> A. U. C. 484. Five Years before the Firſt <hi>Punick</hi> War, Silver began to be coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Stamps upon the Silver <hi>Denarii</hi> are for the moſt part Waggons, with Two or Four Beaſts in them on the one ſide, and on the Reverſe, the Head of <hi>Rome,</hi> with an Helmet. The <hi>Victoriati</hi> have the Image of Victory ſitting; the <hi>Seſtertii</hi> uſually <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollus</hi> on the one ſide, and both on the reverſe the Image of the City: So the Cuſtom continued during the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth. <hi>Auguſtus</hi> caus'd <hi>Capricorn</hi> to be ſet upon his Coin, and the Succeeding Emperours ordinarily their own Effigies: Laſt of all came up Coin of Gold, which was Firſt ſtamp'd Sixty Two Years after that of Silver, in the Conſulſhip of <hi>M. Livius Salinator,</hi> with the ſame Stamp and Images. So much for the ſeveral Kinds of Money, we may now proceed to the ſeveral Pieces under every Kind.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>As</hi> was ſo nam'd <hi>quaſi Aes</hi> or Braſs, being of that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and at firſt Conſiſted of a Pound weight, 'till in the firſt <hi>Punic</hi> War, the People being greatly impoveriſh'd made Six <hi>Aſſes</hi> of the ſame Value out of One. In the Second <hi>Punic</hi> War, <hi>Hannibal</hi> preſſing very hardly upon them, and putting them to great Shifts, the <hi>Aſſes</hi> were reduced to an Ounce a piece; and in Concluſion by a Law of <hi>Papyrius</hi> was brought down to half an Ounce, and ſo continued. The <hi>As</hi> contain'd the tenth

The <hi>Sextans</hi> or Sixth Part was that which every Head contributed to the Funeral of <hi>Menenius Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa;</hi> but theſe were not ſufficient for uſe, and therefore there were other Pieces made, as the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncia</hi> or Twelfth Part of the Pound, the <hi>Semuncia</hi> of the weight of Four <hi>Drachms,</hi> and the <hi>Sextula</hi> or Sixth Part of an Ounce. <hi>Varro</hi> ſpeaks too of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſis</hi> in value Ten <hi>Aſſes,</hi> or of a <hi>Denarius;</hi> the <hi>Viceſſis</hi> of Two <hi>Denarii,</hi> and ſo upwards to the <hi>Centuſſis,</hi> the greateſt Braſs Coin, in Value 100 <hi>Aſſes,</hi> 10 <hi>Denarii,</hi> and of our Money 6 <abbr>

                  <p>The Marks of the ordinary Coins are as follow.

In reckoning by <hi>Seſterces</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> had an Art, which may be underſtood by theſe Three Rules. The Firſt is, If a Numeral Noun agree in Caſe, Gender, and Number, with <hi>Seſtertius,</hi> then it denotes preciſely ſo many <hi>Seſtertii,</hi> as <hi>decem Seſtertii</hi> juſt ſo many. The ſecond is this, If a Numeral Noun of another Caſe be join'd with the Genitive Plural of <hi>Seſtertius,</hi> it denotes ſo many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, as <hi>Decem Seſtertium</hi> ſignifies Ten Thouſand <hi>Seſtertii.</hi> Laſtly, if the Adverb Numeral be join'd, it denotes ſo many Hundred Thouſand, as <hi>Decies Seſtertium</hi> ſignifies Ten Hundred Thouſand <hi>Seſtertii;</hi> or if the Numeral Adverb be put by it ſelf, the Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
